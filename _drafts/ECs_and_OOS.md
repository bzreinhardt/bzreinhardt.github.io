title: EC's and OOS
---

EC actuators are uniquely useful for OOS because of a combination of attributes.
1) They can guarantee safety for both craft - no position can compromise the ability of the EC actuator to repel from the surface, avoiding collisions.
2) They work best at short ranges - providing the best actuation near the surface of the target for visual inspection. 
3) EC actuators make few demands on the system - they do not require fuel or a cooperative target.
