The capabilities of small satellites have exploded thanks to Moore's law and other technologies driven by the computer age. The capabilities of Sputnik can now fit into the palm of your hand. Like any new technology, small satellites can be used in two ways: like PCs they can do what previous iterations did before them, but cheaper or better or they can unlock entirely new capabilities - nobody would ever do a spreadsheet on a huge mainframe. But what fundamentally different space missions do small satellites unlock? One possibility is on-orbit servicing. 

This paper plans to briefly describe the physics of an EC actuator. The physics inform the architecture of an on-orbit inspection vehicle that uses EC forces to move in a plane perpendicular to the surface. Finally the paper will address the capabilities and limitations of this inspection vehicle, constraining itself to 3-DoF (two translational and 1 rotational)
