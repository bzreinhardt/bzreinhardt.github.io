title: Movement modes
---
An EC servicer will need to use several 'modes' to move around the surface of a target. Each of these modes corresponds to a degree of freedom 
<!-- can we just assume that the in the plane movement is decoupled? and then address it from there -->

*X-Y motion* An EC actuator produces motion in the x-y plane by rotating magnets on axes perpendicular to the direction of travel. These [magnet arrays](../terms) induce a shear force between the surface and the actuator, acting like wheels without contact, friction or side-to-side constraints. Two magnet arrays can fully span the space of torque-free forces in the plane. 
<!-- insert pictures here -->

*Rotation* An EC actuator produces torques perpendicular to the plane of motion by generating forces 
<!-- it might be worthwhile to limit the scope of this paper to just in the plane -->
Maintaining holding position

However, to avoid sensitivity to misalignment and modeling errors of the center of mass, four or more arrays 

However, the side to side and rotational actuation and both coupled to our of plane actuation.
