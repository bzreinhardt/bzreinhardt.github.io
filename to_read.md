Stendhal, The Red and the Black
Best translation is the one by Robert M. Adams. Burton Raffel translation is good too.
Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (Excerpts)
Melville, Moby-Dick
Cowen, In Praise of Commercial Culture
The book that convinced me to study economics. (Notes)
Wharton, The House of Mirth
I enjoyed this much more than Age of Innocence.
The title is from Ecclesiastes 7:4: “The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.”
Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty

Runs through the personalities of the 20th century. My favorite book on music.
Epstein, Simple Rules for a Complex World
Proust, Swann’s Way, trans. Lydia Davis (Excerpts)
Thiel & Masters, CS 183 notes & Zero to One (related essay)
If you must pick one, read the lecture notes. The radicalism of the ideas were mainstreamed for the book.
Schelling, Micromotives and Macrobehavior, The Strategy of Conflict
Friedman, The Machinery of Freedom
Laozi, Dao De Jing (Excerpts)
A book about humility.
Mann, 1491
Cowen, Discover Your Inner Economist
The best of the pop-econ books. (Harford comes next, then Frank, Wheelan, and Landsburg. All of these are better than Freakonomics, which won’t teach you very much about economics at all.)
Mallaby, More Money Than God (related essay)
Gertner, The Idea Factory
History of the place that labs that developed radar, transistors, satellites, cell phone telephony, and more.
Adelman, Worldly Philosopher: The Odyssey of Albert O. Hirschman (Notes)

Plato, Dialogues
In particular Crito and Phaedo.
Cowen, The Great Stagnation & Average is Over (Excerpts)
Wolfe, Bonfire of the Vanities (Excerpts)
Fontane, Effi Briest (trans. Ritchie Robertson)
There’s so much nuance; the most exciting plot detail isn’t even described, only discussed afterwards.
The Gladwell books
The best is definitely David and Goliath (Excerpts).
Go ahead and disagree with his inferences, but where else would you find packed together so many great stories you haven’t heard of, and wouldn’t hear of if not for him?
If you still object to his ideas, read him because he’s a great writer.
Ford, Lights in the Tunnel
Zweig, Beware of Pity
Doherty, Radicals for Capitalism
Details the rise of the American libertarian movement. Serious study, but the personalities are so crazy that it’s fun to read.

Frank, The Economic Naturalist
Short stories about the economic way of thinking.
Isaacson, Steve Jobs

Packer, The Unwinding
(Excerpts, with a focus on the Thiel story)

A novel about the interactions of Russell, Wittgenstein, and G.E. Moore. Very fun.

Lewis, The Big Short
Arrison, 100 Plus
Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
Monroe: Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship
McCloskey, Bourgeois Virtues & Bourgeois Dignity
First 50 pages of the Apology in Virtues is most worth reading.
McArdle, The Up Side of Down (Excerpts)
Heinlein, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress
Conrad, Heart of Darkness
Knausgaard, Min Kamp Vol. 1
Uncomfortable, mesmerizing.
Lewis, Liar’s Poker (Excerpts)
Wapshott, Keynes Hayek
Heilbroner, The Worldly Philosophers
The first economics-y book I read; I spent two years of undergrad wondering when we were going to cover Thorstein Veblen.
Thaler & Sunstein, Nudge
Super well argued, I couldn’t continue to be a knee-jerk skeptic.
St. Aubyn, Patrick Melrose series (Excerpts)
When I was little I read most of the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. I really liked them, but haven’t picked any of them up again.
(Chronological from here…)

Stephenson, The Diamond Age
I tweeted: “Wow, does anyone mix fun and deep as well as Neal Stephenson can?” Maybe I just don’t read enough science fiction, but Stephenson’s world is so fun and immersive. Plus, you feel like you’re learning a lot.
Sebald, Austerlitz
Glass, Music Without Words: A Memoir (related essay)
Mann, The Magic Mountain, trans. J.E. Woods
First 150 pages or so are stultifying, but it picks up. The ruminations on death/dying make it worth it.

Really engrossing read on key battles and personalities in WWII.

Kaplan, Wizards of Armageddon
Cirincione, Bomb Scare
Cowen, An Economist Gets Lunch
Glover, Humanity: A Moral History of the Twentieth Century
Cumings, The Korean War (Excerpts)
Stephenson, Cryptonomicon
A lot of science wrapped in a thrilling story.
Palaver, René Girard’s Mimetic Theory (related essay)

Pretty much the perfect nonfiction book: many, many interesting facts weaved into a narrative story; and it’s slim, not going overboard with too much detail.

Scurlock, King Larry: The Life and Ruins of a Billionaire Genius
Parsons, The British Imperial Century
Stargardt, The German War: A Nation Under Arms, 1939–1945
The war from the perspective of the German population. One interesting fact: A quarter of Goebbel’s budget was spent on theatre, which was about as much as he spent on propaganda, and more than twice as much on film.
Pomeranz and Topik, The World That Trade Created
