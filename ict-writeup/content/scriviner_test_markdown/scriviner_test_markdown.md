#Personas

This piece is intended for five types of readers. I'm explicitly calling them out because the whole thing is long and everybody will get more or less value from different sections. You don't need to be a completionist! Selecting a persona below will highlight the headings of some sections and de-emphasize the headings of others in a 'recommended path' for that persona. It won't make anything disappear.

1. **"Persona 1"**: You're this type of reader if you want to put in the legwork to build an innovation organization, especially one that riffs on the DARPA model. In other words, me. In some ways this piece is a very long memo to myself laying out how to spend the next N years of my life and why I'm doing it. If you're in this category, you already (at least slightly) believe strongly enough in the importance of creating new innovation organizations that you want to take action on that belief.
2. **"Persona 2"**: You're this type of reader if you're in the position to support new innovation organizations --- monetarily or otherwise. Creating new innovation organizations isn't going to be your main thing, but you still would like to put your social or financial capital towards the effort. You could be coming from one of many institutional contexts: as a philanthropist, a member of a government, or a capitalist --- either an investor seeking monetary returns or the representative of a corporation looking for technological returns.
3. **"Persona 3"**: You're this type of reader if you are generally interested in the question "how do we enable more creative science and technology in the world?" but perhaps you aren't in a position to be a builder or supporter ... yet.
4. **"Persona 4"**: You're this type of reader if you have an academic interest in innovation and how it works. Maybe you're a historian, economist, or policy person.
5. **"Persona 5"**: You're this type of reader if you're a curious person who doesn't fall into any of the previous three categories but enjoy learning about the world and coming across new ways of thinking. Perhaps you have a professional role where you benefit from understanding what's going in the world of research and emerging technology. Perhaps not!

Of course, you can always **chart your own adventure**.
