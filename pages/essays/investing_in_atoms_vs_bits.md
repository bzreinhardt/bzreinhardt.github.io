Peter Thiel says: "where's my flying car?"
Marc Andressen says: "Software is eating the world"

I agree with both. Software is eating the world because it is where the low hanging fruit is. There are many more returns to investment in software. 

Look at software projects compared to hardware projects. Both take 5 years. But the software project, takes no money except the stuff necessary to pay the people. The expected value of the software is the same or greater than the hardware.
