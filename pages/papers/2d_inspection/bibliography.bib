@article{Jujun2014,
abstract = {The current generation pattern of e-waste consisted of dead electronic and electrical equipments poses one of the world's greatest pollution problem due to the lack of appropriate recovery technology. Crude recovery methods of resource materials (aluminum, zinc, copper, lead, gold) from e-waste caused serious pollution in China in the past years. Thus, environment-friendly technologies have been the pressing demand in e-waste recovering. Eddy current separation (ECS) was advised as the preferable technology for recovering nonferrous metals from e-waste. However, just a few reports focused on the application of ECS in e-waste recovering. This paper introduced the information about ECS including the models of eddy current force and movement behavior of nonferrous metallic particle in the separation process. Meanwhile, the developing process of eddy current separator was summarized. New industrial applications of ECS in e-waste (waste toner cartridges and refrigerator cabinets) recovering were also presented. Finally, for improving separation rate of ECS in industrial application of e-waste recovering, some suggestions were proposed related to crushing process, separator design, and separator operation. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of ECS technology as practical and available tool for recovering non-ferrous metals from e-waste which is now being ignored.},
