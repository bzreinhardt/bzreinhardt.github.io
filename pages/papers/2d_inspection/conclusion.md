There are many paths for future induction coupler research. The frequency response of the system and its sensitivity to system state and environment are important to future designs. This analysis assumed planar motion - remaining in that plane is a challenge in itself, and ideally the inspection vehicle would have full 6-degree-of-freedom maneuverability. 

This paper presents a starting point for induction coupler technology. It describes [the physics](physics) of spinning magnet arrays producing contactless forces and torques on any conductive target. [Preliminary experiments verified and measured these forces](behavior). [When coupled together, three or more arrays can produce 3 independent degrees of freedom in the plane above the target's surface.](jacobian)  

[This paper presents a completely new method for small-spacecraft mobility.](intro)Induction couplers can generate forces between an inspection spacecraft and any conductive target using only electric power and without physical contact. This capability is especially valuable for [on-orbit servicing of valuable targets like the ISS.](mission)
