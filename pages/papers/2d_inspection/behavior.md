Spinning-magnet induction couplers consist of  <a name = "array"> arrays </a> of one or more permanent magnets spinning on axes perpendicular to their dipole moment. The perpendicular orientation between the dipole moment and the spin axis maximizes the changes in the magnetic field as a motor spins the magnets. For consistency, these arrays are portrayed as a single dipole, but could consist of any number of magnets.[^1] <!-- TODO put in magnet picture -->

The simplest induction-coupled system is a single array spinning on an axis perpendicular to a flat conductive surface. In this case, the coupler will produce a force perpendicular to <!-- the spin axis crossed with the surface --> \\( \mathbf{\omega} \times \textbf{r} \\).

Each array can only directly generate a force. The array can use this force to torque the spacecraft if it is located so there is a moment arm between the spacecraft's center of mass and the array. Experimental demonstration of an induction coupler have shown that these forces vary with the magnitude and sign of \\(\mathbf{\omega}\\). [Preliminary results](../edge_walking/air_track_force_analysis.html) show milliNewton shear forces perpendicular to a surface using small motors and permanent magnets. Two small motors[^4] driven by 12V at a 25% duty cycle while holding two neodymium permanent magnets have together generated 5 mN, or 2.5 mN apiece. Spinning at 4200 RPM, each motor drew 0.25 amps of current, dissipating 0.75 Watts of electrical power. This power consumption corresponds to a 3.33 mN/Watt force per power ratio.

 The angular velocity of the array can control the force because the induced voltage scales with \\(\left \| v \times B \right \| \\) where \\(v = \omega \times d\\)[^2] is the relative velocity between the target conductor and the magnetic field.[^3]

<a name = "dependencies"></a>
The force between the spinning array and the target also depends both on the system state, he design of the induction coupler, and the properties of the target. The forces decrease with \\(\frac{1}{d^4}\\). Larger magnets will increase the forces generated by the induction coupler for a given spin speed. Greater thickness and conductivity of the target both increase the induced current and scale the force.

[^1]: As the number of magnets increases on an array of a given size, the magnetic field will necessarily become smoother, becoming uniform as the number of magnets goes to infinity. This smoothing decreases the change in the magnetic field as the magnets spin. The number of magnets per array is one of the many considerations in the design of an induction coupler.

[^3]: The direct scaling between force and \\(\omega\\) makes two assumptions: that \\(\frac{1}{\omega\\}) is much larger than the characteristic time of the inductor and that the relative velocity between the inspection spacecraft and the target is much smaller than the tangential velocity of the magnetic field seen by the target.
