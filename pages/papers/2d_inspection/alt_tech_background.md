<!-- Other technologies -->
<!--### Contactless Actuatoion-->

There are other technologies that can produce contactless forces between a spacecraft and a target. Coulombic forces can mediate interactions between two charged spacecraft. <!--ref--> A number of different systems produce contactless forces with magnetic interactions between controlled dipoles on both the spacecraft and the target. [2][2], [4][4]<!-- ref utah, ref RINGS, ref colorado --> All of these systems require a subsystem on both the chaser and the target (that is, the target must be cooperative.) However, none of the possible targets currently in orbit meet these criteria. Laser tweezers can produce contactless forces on an uncooperative target.[1][1]  However, the target must be smaller than a micrometer - a size restriction that <!--Um, holy shit, they actually put up dust-size spacecraft targets?!?-->few spacecraft targets currently in orbit can meet. The restrictions of current technology leaves direct contact as the only option to create forces between two spacecraft.
