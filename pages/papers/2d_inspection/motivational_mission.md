A small inspection spacecraft can use induction couplers to crawl along the surface of a larger target spacecraft without physically grappling the target. The inspector can fulfill a number of functions including investigating problematic areas, scanning for damage, performing small tasks, or providing support for astronauts on space walks. This paper will focus on the International Space Sation <a name="iss">(ISS)</a>, but a similar inspection spacecraft could enable unique OOS missions to inspect and repair other large satellites.

The inspection spacecraft would use induction couplers to pull itself along the aluminum surface of the ISS, maintaining a separation distance of a few centimeters. 

The ability to span the exterior of the ISS without being constrained by rails or fuel supply can free up one of the most valuable resources on
