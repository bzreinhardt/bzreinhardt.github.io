<!-- What is an induction coupler -->
An induction coupler uses magnetic eddy currents to create forces between itself and a conductive target. The coupler doesn't require direct contact with a target or cooperation from the target. The coupler can also operate on electricity alone, rather than requiring fuel or propellant. If you note that most satellites are skinned in aluminum, this makes induction couplers the closest thing we have to science fiction's tractor beam - a device that can produce contactless forces on an uncooperative target. 

Induction couplers could be particularly useful in space, for three major reasons. First, small forces can have large effects because they are not overwhelmed by gravity, friction, or drag. Second, objects designed for space tend to be fragile, so the ability to interact without potentially damaging direct contact is valuable. Third, propellant and fuel is at a premium in space so the ability to mutually maneuver without expendables can cut costs and extend the usable lifetime of a spacecraft.

A small spacecraft could use an induction coupler to control its own dynamics relative to a much larger target like the International Space Station, crawling along the targets surface without ever touching like the underwater robots that now inspect pipelines and shipwrecks. Increased interest in on-orbit servicing <a name="oos"> </a> (OOS) provides compelling motivation for developing induction couplers. A small inspection vehicle will be primarily concerned with planar motion perpendicular to the surface of the target. This paper will present how this planar motion can be achieved by a small spacecraft equipped with induction couplers.
