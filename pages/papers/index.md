[AIAA Space 2011 Conference paper about the physics of induction couplers and using them in spacecraft.][space2011]

[AIAA GNC 2012 Conference paper about how you can't use a single magnet to pull on a plate without system dynamics.][GNC2012]

[AIAA SciTech 2014 Conference paper about building a spacecraft test bed from commercial, off-the-shelf parts.][scitech2014]

[A web-first science (make it for the web before you make it for a piece of paper) writeup of spinning magnet induction coupler experiments and analysis.][edgewalking]
