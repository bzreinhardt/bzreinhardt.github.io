- Do not say "we should catch up." Say "Would you like to catch up? <insert proposal for what catching up would entail here>" The latter invites a negotiation. The former places the true burden of initiation on the other person.

- If someone has headphones on, send them an asynchronous message instead of interrupting them.

- Any time you are working on a project, big or small, create a blurb about it. Should be able to recite it from memory and copy it in text w/in 5 seconds. #Networking

- Separating pieces of info is a sin. It forces people to context switch to try to understand. (Ex. Diagrams with labels and long description referencing them)

- Don't half ass things. This is what Yoda actually meant.

- Do not make glossy business cards. People need to write on them.

- Always put toilet paper so it unrolls outward

- If you actually want to help, ask questions. 

- Be very judicious with criticism and putting work on people's plates. 

- Links should always be sharable 

- Ghosting when making time-sensitive
 plans is pure disrespect

- Initiative is love

- You need to earn docking around

- Giving false hope is worse than no hope at all

- Apps should autosave. Your brain doesn't ask you if you want to remember something.

- Logins for webpages should never take you away from the page you were on.

- "Back" on a browser should take you to the page *in the same state as it was before*

- Response rate is subject dependent - if you're in the act of planning with someone fast responses do not signal neediness

- Pre-ask questions that are time-independent before it's crunch time. Last minute info asking puts all the work on the other person.

- Whenever you ask for a potentially vulnerable piece of information, offer your own first. 

- Whenever you reject a proposal, offer a counterproposal if you are interested and say that you're uninterested if you're uninterested. Anything else is keeping optionality at the expense of the other party.
