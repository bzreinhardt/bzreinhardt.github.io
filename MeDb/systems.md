Some things that I feel I have managed to systematize - happy to go into detail on any.

- Dating
- Lifting 
- Meditation
- Meeting new people
- Building new habits
- Shoulder mobility
- Making the most out of parties or gatherings
- Podcasting
- Making the most out of conferences



Things that I don't have good systems for and would love help with:
- Learning from experts 
- Fostering mentors
- Self promotion
- High-level decision making
- Fostering collaborators
