##Read
- Creative Capital - 11/21/2018. Terrible writing but fascinating story. Doriot was truly a man who passed on his Memes and not his Genes. Need creditability to push risk and timescales. Big point that human incentives always matter and at the end of the day brought down ARD.
- Superforecasters (Audio) - 11/20/2018. A bit repetitive. Amazing that he steel mans his own arguments especially near the end. People should write books about their own research.
- Bird by Bird (Audio) - 11/12/2018. Good writing, need to figure out how it is applicable to non fiction. Reminds me of my mom.


- Founders Dilemmas- ? 


The Three Body Problem (Audio) - 4/5/2018 - really bothers me because it violates reality with *no explanation*
---
The Little Red Book of Selling - 1/26/2018 - Comes a bit strong on the philosophy. Very actionable tings, No BS. A lot of of it confirms my biases towards personal branding and networking, etc.

Anathem (Audio book) - 1/1/2018
SevenEves (Audio Book) - 1/13/2018 - Fucking Amazing
Tunnel In the Sky (Audio Book)
Between the Stars (Audio Book)
Tribe (Audio Book) 2/6/2018 - Some important concepts. Gender roles in groups regardless of genders. Loneliness inversely correlated to intensity of situations. Tribes need rituals.
