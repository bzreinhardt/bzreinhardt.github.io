<p>Since installing Mac OSX Mavericks yesterday, my computer has crashed more than once per hour - three times while writing this post, clearly trying to keep me from tattling. The problem probably lies in a faulty video card aggravated by a modern, flashy OS, rather than Mavericks itself.</p>
<p>Regardless, the experience has helped me solidify a key criteria that good technology must meet: A good technology should eliminate, rather than add, barriers standing in the way of spending time on important things.</p>
<p>Important things can be anything from spending time with loved ones to building an awesome new thing. I need to check that the sensors are working so that I can measure the position of an air cart so that I can create a feedback loop in order to actually test my ideas about implementing an eddy current actuators. What I actually want to do is three layers deep. And I'm one of the lucky ones.</p>
<p>Less-than-useful technologies like a crashing computer or apps with more bells and whistles than you can count add layers. Good technologies, like cars, telephones and indoor plumbing remove them. Unfortunately, I think a lot of new, cute, apps fall into the latter category because inventors and entrepreneurs don't keep the distinction in mind.</p>
