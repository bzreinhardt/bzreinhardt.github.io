<p>Some big space news items this week are the <a href="http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/rep-smith-and-bolden-square-off-on-asteroid-mission" target="_blank">NASA authorization bill from the House Space Subcommittee and subsequent debate over the proposed asteroid mission</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/rogozin-disputes-stories-of-improperly-installed-sensors-on-proton" target="_blank">political fallout from the Proton rocket crash.</a></p>
<p>Both of these stories beg the question: is there a reason that space exploration <b>needs</b> to be so closely tied to politicians besides precedent, power and publicity?</p>
<p>It just makes me shake my head and wish that ‘space politics’ only referred to the goings on in the Grand Galactic Senate.</p>
