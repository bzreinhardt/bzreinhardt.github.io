<p>A short post today due to:</p>
<p> A)   Having a lot of fun tuning the control gains on the MTF (microgravity test facility – the official acronym even though I’d rather call it the MTA: microgravity test assembly), that now has vaguely working feedback.  There’s something very satisfying about the ability to move a huge crane system around by poking on it with the edge of a piece of paper.</p>
<p>B)   A bunch of time spent at the <a href="http://newspace.spacefrontier.org/" target="_blank">NewSpace 2013 conference</a>. It was quite fun to be around tons of people who also seem to be trying to do a tightrope walk along the tinfoil hat line. My response to a lot of what I saw and heard was “that’s freaking awesome … if it works.” A smattering of examples:</p>
<p>Spacesuit components</p>
<p>reconfigurable, scalable space modules,</p>
<p>space-certified 3D printers,</p>
<p>space industry video games (Sim Private Space Company)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.teapartyinspace.org/" target="_blank">Tea Party..in Spaaaace </a>(no seriously, that’s what they call themselves)</p>
<p> </p>
