<p>The deluge of end-of-year related media seems to take two forms: recaps of the past year and predictions for the future. (Interestingly, there aren’t a lot of year-end reports along the lines of ‘and here’s what I’m doing RIGHT NOW’) Many predictions involve technology: will 2014 be the year of the 3-D printed, cloud-neural network quantum-computing autonomous cars?!?!?! (Answer: No.)</p>
<p>For everybody who thinks fusion powered utopia is just around the corner, it seems there are at least ten naysayers who think technological optimists are just indulging sci-fi daydreams. Although anecdotes aren’t proof, many very smart people, through their own pessimism, have inadvertently offered up counter-evidence for a pessimistic viewpoint. Check it out:</p>
<ul>
<li>"A rocket will never be able to leave the Earth's atmosphere." -- <i>The New York Times</i> , 1920.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"There is no likelihood man can ever tap the power of the atom." -- Robert Millikan , winner of the 1923 Nobel Prize in physics, 1928.</li>
<li>"Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible."  -- Scottish mathematician and creator of the Kelvin temperature scale William Thomson, Lord Kelvin , 1895.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home." -- Ken Olsen , founder and president of Digital Equipment Corporation, 1977 .</li>
</ul>
<p>(Quotes from <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/23/the-shape-of-the-future-how-to-help-tomorrows-chil.aspx" target="_blank">this long article</a> on the Motley Fool) </p>
<p>The anecdote usually mentioned in this context - the patent officer claiming in 1902 that everything useful had already been invented - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Holland_Duell" target="_blank">is apocryphal.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/fragile-five/" target="_blank">You should be skeptical of any tech prediction more than five years down the road</a>, and ‘never’ is about the most far-off prediction there is.</p>
<p>So how do you strike a balance between deluded optimism and stick-in-the-mud pessimism? Don’t just predict a future, choose the one you want the most.  Work backwards to the actionable item for the next year to make your future a reality starting in 2014.</p>
