<p>Some first-day-at-Ames related observations: </p>
<p>It’s really a testament to the productivity of the actual engineers and scientists at NASA that despite the ever-increasing amount of government imposed slogging, they have managed to keep turning out awesome things (did you know there was a plane with a telescope coming out of <a href="http://www.sofia.usra.edu/">its freaking side</a>? I didn’t.) Has anyone ever done a study of how many man-hours of the nation’s best and brightest have been wasted in government mandated presentations and training?</p>
<p>Example: all the Interns were welcomed by 3.5 hours of powerpoints (including one on what groups we couldn’t discriminate against in our hiring practices and another describing a boating accident to illustrate the point that “bad things you’re not prepared for can happen.”) These literally could have been distilled to about 30 minutes easily.</p>
<p> The series of presentation was a perfect example of the cultural clash at Ames: it started off with “yeah! Check out how innovative we are!” and quickly degraded into</p>
<p> It turns out gift shops are profitable while cafeterias are not (even when charging $8/lb for salad.) </p>
<p> The use of citizenship as a binary measure of trustworthiness confuses me.  “Oh, well if you were born here or took a test, clearly you won’t tell anybody.” I suppose it’s low-downside (for the military) way to keep out a subgroup who does have a slightly higher probability of being spies.</p>
<p> Hopefully an “awesome-things-I’ll-be-working-on” post tomorrow.  </p>
