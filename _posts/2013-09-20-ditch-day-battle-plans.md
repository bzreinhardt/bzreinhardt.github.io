<p>Nine hours. Eight AM to five PM. A normal work-day can often pass by like a snap.</p>
<p>But Ditch Day is anything but normal: it’s amazing how long nine hours can seem when you feel responsible for filling every minute of it with undiluted awesomesauce of your own design. And yet in a bizarre case of Schrödinger’s Scheduling, there’s also nowhere near enough time for all the awesome puzzles you’ve been dreaming about for years.</p>
<p>And it’s not just a matter of saying ‘well ok, they’ll watch this lecture for an hour, take five minutes to walk to the next location, where they’ll do a supervised activity that will be timed for 45 minutes… etc.’ Not at all. It’s a matter of trying to guess how long an group of unknown (from within a subset) group of Caltech undergrads (certainly not known for predictability) will take to finish a series of tasks <i>that have never been completed before. </i></p>
<p>Testing by friends or alumni can give some puzzles a rough time estimate, but between the variations in prior knowledge (“hey, this puzzle is just like this one I saw in a magazine three years ago!” vs. “So…where’s the puzzle?”) and external circumstances, it’s like trying to extrapolate from a small experiment in a lab to the real world in extremely non-ideal conditions.  Other puzzles really are one-shot affairs and their time-footprint can only be guessed.</p>
<p>Combine those considerations with my desire to weave a coherent story through the puzzles and planning became a terrifying beast. It involved layers of buffers, contingencies, what-ifs, and a really big whiteboard (spoiler alert):</p>

<p>As the weeks ticked down towards Ditch Day, Oren and Mike’s huge double essentially became our war room. Random electronics, maps, sketches, and drying painted objects were strewn wall to wall.</p>
<p>In the end most stacks hit surprisingly close to the 8-5 mark, an amazing feat in and of itself when you think about it, let alone what creating what happens in that time period. (I’m getting there, I swear!)</p>
