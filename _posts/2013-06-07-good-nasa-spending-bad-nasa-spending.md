<p>Years ago, the awesome kid’s TV show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamaniacs" target="_blank">Anamaniacs</a> sometimes had a short segment called ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8PhzrmBgMI" target="_blank">Good Idea, Bad Idea</a>’ that contrasted two semantically similar, but hilariously different ideas (just watch the video in the link – it’s sort.)</p>
<p>I was reminded of ‘Good Idea, Bad Idea’ by two recent articles about two separate NASA initiatives, both with similar price tags of about $1.5 Million. The contrast is striking.</p>
<p>Good NASA Spending:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/05/us-usa-robots-idUSBRE95419T20130605" target="_blank">Using the incredibly effective mechanism of competition to encourage innovation.</a></p>
<p>Bad NASA Spending:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20130605_Mars_habitat_program_on_Mauna_Loa_gets_12M_NASA_grant.html" target="_blank"> Yet another simulated Mars mission.</a>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_500" target="_blank">How many</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/03/mock-mars-mission-training-program-arctic_n_3378859.html" target="_blank">are necessary</a>?  There are only so many permutations of ‘let’s observe what happens when a small group of people live in a box together in the middle of nowhere and have to wear funny clothes a lot.’</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m missing a bigger picture, but it really strikes me as another example of <a href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/06/02/risk-aversion-paralysis/" target="_blank">risk aversion paralysis</a>.</p>
