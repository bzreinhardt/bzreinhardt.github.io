<p>Venting alert!</p>
<p>One of the big space stories this week is a study published in Science <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/space-radiation-makes-mars-mission-hazardous/2013/05/30/1acd1542-c94a-11e2-9245-773c0123c027_story.html" target="_blank">showing the levels of radiation in deep space can be hazardous to your health</a>. NASA’s reaction to this data (that was measured by the Curiosity rover on it’s way to Mars - very cool) is just another example of NASA’s risk aversion. I sadly feel that the agency doesn’t embody the spirit of the explorers it once did, but instead reflects our increasingly paternalistic society.</p>
<p>Oh no! The astronauts might not be able to have children!</p>
<p>Has anybody asked <strong>the astronauts </strong>whether the risk is worth it?</p>
<p>Our paternalistic society frowns upon people <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2012/01/26/how-much-is-an-astronauts-life-worth" target="_blank">deciding their own acceptable levels of risk</a> and volunteering themselves for science and exploration.</p>
<p>A quote <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/exploring-a-possible-mission-to-mars/2013/05/06/a234afda-b5b9-11e2-92f3-f291801936b8_story.html">from the Washington Post</a> illustrates part of the presumptuous, paternalistic attitude that is holding back exploration:</p>
<blockquote><p> “Of all the hazards facing a human mission to Mars — something NASA and countless space buffs would love to see at some point — one of the hardest to solve is the radiation that saturates interplanetary space”</p></blockquote>
<p>They assume that of course, one can know <strong>all</strong> the hazards before actually trying.</p>
<p>We can’t let each risk consideration continue to delay our conquest of space – for each known risk <a href="http://www.space.com/21375-manned-mars-mission-radiation-propulsion.html">that sets timetables back</a>, there are probably twenty that we <b>don’t even know about</b>.  Just as in anything else, you could literally spend forever weighing the options, <a href="http://www.americaspace.com/?p=36587">practicing</a> and optimizing.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just need to jump.</p>
