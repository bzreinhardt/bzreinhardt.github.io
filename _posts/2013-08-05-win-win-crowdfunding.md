<p>I'm a big fan of entrepreneurial win-win situations and from what I can tell, <a href="http://igg.me/at/9duino/x/4278397" target="_blank">this indiegogo campaign is one of those</a>: kids get introduced to electronics, people like me get cheap Arduino clones, and the guy running it gets to have his name out there.</p>
<p>If you're interested in home electronics, I would check it out.</p>
