<p>Considering how prevalent it is, converting analog data (ie. the real world) to digital form is a piece of our technological portfolio that is still surprisingly difficult to get right.</p>
<p> As much as some CS majors may like to ignore it, computers that interact with the real world need to do this conversion.  It’s a difficult problem partially because the digital devices for the most part have no way of knowing whether the data they’re getting is ‘good enough’ to act on – leading to some annoying situations. Another problem is that once it’s digitized, data looks far more clean and official than it may actually be.</p>
<p> These musings come courtesy of a day filled with events tied together by this theme:</p>
<p> The undergraduates working with me on the Eddy Current project are constantly running into problems with digitized signals from an analog accelerometer.</p>
<p> I spent a long time striving to get the voice recognizer on my phone to work consistently – it’s good about 80% of the time, which is just enough to inspire hope, but bad enough to be untrustworthy.</p>
<p> One of the major hurdles of the microgravity test apparatus we’re working on is getting good, accurate data from the analog sensors to the digital feedback loops.</p>
<p> It seems like every time data needs to be digitized, there is a different system to do it, leading to a lot of redundant effort. Luckily there are a lot of smart people who also recognize this problem, and that there is a lot of money to be made in solving it – in my mind their improvements can’t come fast enough. </p>
