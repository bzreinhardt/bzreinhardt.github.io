<p><a href="http://www.space.com/21452-interstellar-spaceflight-starship-congress.html" target="_blank">This article</a> about <a href="http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/">Icarus Interstellar’s</a> attempts to generate excitement about interstellar travel inadvertently brought up something I think is a very serious unaddressed issue in space research, science in general, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Specifically, the opening sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If humanity is serious about traveling to other star star systems in the foreseeable future, it needs to get the ball rolling now, say experts”</p></blockquote>
<p>Who are these experts? What makes them experts? What are they even experts on? The article never says.</p>
<p>The concept of experts – those with knowledge of a subject that somehow transcends our own to dwell in a discretely different domain - is endemic to almost any subject.  Certainly, there are people who know more, perhaps much more than others about a subject. But drawing a line –the experts on one side looking down at the rest of us basking in their knowledge is both silly and dangerous:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who decides who is an expert and who merely knows a lot? Is it relative or absolute? Mr. Smith may knows more about physics than anybody else in nowheresville, but compared to Stephen Hawking, he knows very little. Is he an expert?</li>
<li>Related to the above, amounts of knowledge are basically continuous, so any sort of “expert cut-off” is silly.</li>
<li>Separating out experts and giving their proclamations more weight leads to mental laziness – instead of doing their own research and forming their own thoughts, people can just defend a position with the argument that “the expert said so.”</li>
<li>Not only is deferring to experts lazy, but dangerous as well.  It is the danger always inherent to simply accepting something handed down by an authority figure.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not arguing that one shouldn’t weight the opinions of someone more knowledgeable more highly, simply that there is no level of knowledge that makes their opinions discretely better.</p>
