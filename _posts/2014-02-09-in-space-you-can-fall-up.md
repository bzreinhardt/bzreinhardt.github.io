<p>Whenever I explain my research, the conversation goes something like</p>
<p>Me: "I'm working on a concept for a contact-less spacecraft actuator"</p>
<p>Them: "A what?"</p>
<p>Me: "*sigh* I'm trying to make a tractor beam."</p>
<p>That, combined with our lab's youtube videos being listed along with the perpetual motion machines always makes me feel a bit quackish.</p>
<p>But when I outline using EC actuators to take advantage of an object's natural <a href="http://www.spacecraftresearch.com/blog/?p=521" target="_blank">tendency to fall up on the underside of the ISS</a>, I'm talking about legit science, I swear!</p>
