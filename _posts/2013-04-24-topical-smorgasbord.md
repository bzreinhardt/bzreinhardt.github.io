<p>I’ve been very busy, so today’s posts is a couple of links following up on previous posts as well as some shameless self-promotion.</p>
<p>In addition to <a title="Columbus vs. ColumBot" href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/04/06/columbus-vs-columbot/" target="_blank">my thoughts on the matter</a>, <a href="http://www.space.com/20775-mars-life-search-manned-missions.html" target="_blank">here are some further arguments</a> about why we need to be sending people and not robots to mars.</p>
<p>In the article, even Prof. Steve Squires, a Cornellian and prominent proponent of robotic planetary science missions admits the benefits:</p>
<blockquote><p> "The unfortunate truth is that most things our rovers can do in a perfect sol [Martian day], a human explorer on the scene could do in less than a minute."</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.universetoday.com/101627/spacex-grasshopper-flies-high/" target="_blank">The grasshopper flies again – higher and for longer.</a>  <a title="Coolest. Inverted Pendulum. Ever." href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/coolest-inverted-pendulum-ever/" target="_blank">Still the coolest inverted pendulum I’ve ever seen</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, while significantly smaller in scale than the grasshopper,<a href="http://www.spacecraftresearch.com/blog/?p=169" target="_blank"> I made my own technological leap this week as well.</a></p>
