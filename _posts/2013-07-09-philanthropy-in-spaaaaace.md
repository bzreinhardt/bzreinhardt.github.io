<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597141632/cat-a-thruster-for-interplanetary-cubesats" target="_blank">Here’s yet another Kickstarter for a small, possibly awesome space project.</a></p>
<p> The proposal has received a stamp of feasibility from colleagues who have cubesat and cubesat propulsion knowledge that I trust.  Also note the images of actual developed hardware rather than just pretty graphics.</p>
<p> A thought on the bigger picture: the number of small and feasible but unfunded space projects suggests that there is a need for a new paradigm for funding not-for-profit space exploration.</p>
<p> My proposition: Space Philanthropy.  From the money raised for projects like Kicksat and Arkid, there are many people who are willing to give away money to further space exploration. Why shouldn’t the goal of spreading humanity across the stars be considered in the same category as eliminating hunger and disease?  Both are grand visions of a more awesome future for the human race.  </p>
