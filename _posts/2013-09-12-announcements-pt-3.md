<p>Ah yes, the actual Ditch Day announcement. I hope you’re reading these posts in order and have had to wait a bit for this one.  The atmosphere of unspoken sentiment that pervades the dining hall: “Get to the announcements! We know they’re coming. Between the hint-hint wink-wink emails, the periodic banning of non-seniors from the dining hall and the alumni now helping pack dinner wall to wall, we know it’s going to happen! Come on already!”</p>
<p>And of course, most Ditch Day announcements are better if you get their references so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAl28d6tbko" target="_blank">here is some background viewing</a> that might increase your appreciation. Oh, and the little bit of background reading is the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy.</p>
<p>I walk into the dining hall in full lab safety gear – googles, coat, and welding gloves to the intro music of ‘Will it blend?’ and announced that I am Tom Dickson. (Suspension of disbelief pervades announcements as well as ditch day itself.) “I wonder if this banana will blend?”</p>
<p>On a conveniently placed table at the front of the Dining hall sits my trusty ‘BlendTec Blender.’ I pop the banana in and what do you know? A banana will blend.</p>
<p>“Now, that’s all I had planned for today,” I announce, pulling a ring on a chain out of my pocket, “but on my way in to work I found this shiny ring on the ground. Which of course raises the question – will it blend?”</p>
<p>I hold out my hand to drop the ring in, but then quickly pull it back. I try again, but my hand can’t quite seem to let go.  Finally, through sheer willpower, I get the ring out of my grip and into the blender. “Here we go!”</p>
<p>I turn on the blender, and suddenly there is a screeching explosion within! As the smoke clears, I pull off the top and reach in to grab … the fully intact ring.</p>
<p>Pulling back my goggles, I say in astonishment “If a BlendTec blender can’t destroy it… there is only one other way …”</p>

<p>“It must be taken across rivers and over mountains. Through darkness and water. It must be taken to its very birthplace – Orodruin – and cast into the fires from whence it was forged! Few friends will aid you, and many enemies will bar your path.”</p>
<p>“You have a long journey ahead of you frosh, so go to bed –because DITCH DAY IS TOMORROW!”</p>
