<p>For those of you interested in a broad overview of the cutting edge of space exploration, or just in need of a space excitement boost:</p>
<p>Mason Peck, the NASA Chief Technologist (who also happens to be my PhD advisor) did an AMA on Reddit yesterday.  He answers a swath of questions about the future of space exploration – both near and far term; public and private; crazy and … slightly less crazy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1epdv7/i_am_mason_peck_nasas_chief_technologist_ask_me/">The full thread</a> (includes some good discussion and reference links)</p>
<p><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> </span><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">If you understandably wish to avoid Internet discussions, </span><a style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1epnwp/">here’s a compilation of just the questions and direct answers.</a><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> </span></p>
<p>My personal favorite comment: ‘"Mason Peck" is an anagram of "Space Monk." Is nobody else suspicious here.’</p>
