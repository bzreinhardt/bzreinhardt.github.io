<p>In other NASA related news, the agency is at the center of yet another <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=44228" target="_blank">budgetary hearing</a> and <a href="http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/nelson-pessimitic-about-nasa-authorization-bill-implores-aerospace-commmunity-to-help" target="_blank">subsequent congressional debate</a>.  This happens so frequently that each individual instance has begun to meld into the next in my mind.  </p>
<p>While I agree with <a href="http://josephshoer.com/blog/2013/06/a-difficult-question-for-space-advocates/" target="_blank">Joe Shoer</a> that NASA’s lack of an overarching goal provides fodder to the paralyzing funding conflicts, I think that much deeper there is something rotten in the state of NASA.  This problem is highlighted by this quote from the SpacePolicyOnline article:</p>
<blockquote><p>“He (Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) [Ben’s Note: Florida has many jobs and businesses bankrolled by NASA funding] tried to rally those in the room -- mostly aerospace industry representatives --  to fight for a higher NASA budget. “</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To those with power, NASA is no longer about passionate pursuit of a goal (even if that goal was giving a big ‘up yours’ to the Soviets) it’s about money, who controls it, and where it goes.</p>
<p>An extremely-related-but-unrelated headline and article blurb from today’s NYT:</p>
<blockquote><p><b><a href="http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=4z5Q7LhI+KVBjmEgFdYACPLKh239P3pgk6UxPXRxIzl5qfeprZRkPNQW/iZ9IBefdeTZOS29YzVCdoqALqieq2+/JKvgxBn1dphQViaxSSeusT9nN7P8DVYQK+Z9i/7fZixk9wQf6da8ivO3LOvEviMxMhFbycBbzFYg85hTQdiqbGkflTxajSh+6YpVRsJcVI68KudgfEH6dQYU0YgcaQ==&amp;campaign_id=129&amp;instance_id=29942&amp;segment_id=47810&amp;user_id=c77f29fa6d6f986dbd8f81f5875dadcd" target="_blank">Farmers Say Bill's Defeat Complicates Planning for Planting Season</a> - </b>The failure of the House to pass a new five-year farm bill has blindsided the agriculture industry, leaving it facing uncertainty, "the one thing you can't have in this business."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things that should affect farmer’s planning for the planting season: the weather, the price of seed, anticipated crop prices.  Things that should affect our ability to go to space: the weather, physics, technological advances. Things that shouldn’t affect either of those things: congressional quibbling.</p>
