<p>Working in both academia and government, it feels like I’m exposed to the maximum possible amount of face-palm-inducing bureaucratic shenanigans.  I’ve collected some good quotes that hopefully illustrate why bloated edifices of red tape and generalized rules fill me with alternating rage and despair:</p>
<p> Teacher incentives:</p>
<blockquote><p>"If a student does earn a D, they are given a semester to upgrade it to a C -- <span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;font-style:italic;">with the threat that if not, they will be asked to leave [the school] anyway. And since the teacher who gave the D would have to put in extra work, without pay, </span><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;font-style:italic;">over the following term to help the D-student do this.... what teacher is going to give a grade of D knowing that the consequence is more work </span><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;font-style:italic;">and headache for themselves?"</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Vacation time:</p>
<blockquote><p>'I have hit the maximum of accumulated vacation, so I have been taking Fridays off as "use it or lose it".'</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Safety:</p>
<blockquote><p>"[the wiring that doesn’t have expensive precautions to keep someone from being electrocuted] is unacceptable even though it's low voltage [less than your phone]  – it’s still electricity"</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Equipment training:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You’ll have to take a practical test on operating the equipment, which will be kind of weird because the instructor giving the test won’t actually know anything about [the custom equipment that the test is for.]”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
