<p>The economist <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/03/my_talk_on_fina.html" target="_blank">Arnold Kling inadvertently did a great job of describing how we need to shift the paradigms of spacecraft design.</a> I’ve replaced only one word in this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p> “We tend to think of the task of engineering as one of making systems hard to break. An alternative to consider is making systems easy to fix. Think of a computer. You can try to use firewalls and anti-virus software to make your computer hard to break. But it still pays to back up your data to make it easy to fix.“</p></blockquote>
<p>The substitution changes the meaning entirely, but doesn’t alter the truthiness at all.</p>
<p>I look at it this way: both things that are easy to fix and those that are hard to break are robust. ‘Robust’ spans the gap between fragile and antifragile. Hard-to-break is on ‘fragile’ end of the spectrum while easy-to-fix is closer to ‘antifragile.’</p>
<p>I’ve used this example before, but what are two of the coolest fictional spacecraft? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenium_Falcon" target="_blank">The Millennium Falcon</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_(Firefly_vessel)" target="_blank">The Serenity</a>. What do they have in common besides a roguish, gun-slinging captain, a crew avoiding the authorities, smuggling compartments and frequent comparisons to various trash receptacles?</p>
<p>They’re both really easy to fix. On top of being a great plot device, I think in the end it allows earned confidence, rather than assumed confidence.</p>
<p>A lot of technology has trended towards ‘hard to break’ – cars, phones, and appliances come to mind. In these cases, hard-to-break may be preferable because the replacement costs have dropped dramatically, both in terms of money and effort.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re millions of miles from the nearest mailbox, you can’t exactly a replacement ship on Amazon. Given the remote hostility of space, which category would you rather your ship fall into?   I know which one I’d choose.</p>
