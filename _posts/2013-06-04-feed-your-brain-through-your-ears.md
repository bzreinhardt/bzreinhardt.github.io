<p>Following up on yesterdays salute to SMBC, something that I only discovered today:</p>
<p>It also turns out that Mr. Weiner co-hosts a <a href="http://www.weeklyweinersmith.com/" target="_blank">podcast</a> with his wife. It's cool and worth mentioning here because</p>
<ul>
<li>They bring you awesome science things but with a critical eye towards those inconvenient details and incentives that most reporting misses - basically the same schtick I'm attempting with this blog (albeit with more focus on space.) So if you find my writing relevant, you should check out the podcast.</li>
<li>Mike Munger <a href="http://www.weeklyweinersmith.com/?p=265" target="_blank">discusses his awesome ideas</a> on the problems with the grant system that heavily informed <a href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/funding-fixes-pt-1/" target="_blank">my own thoughts</a> on <a href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/03/31/funding-fixes-pt-2/" target="_blank">the matter</a>. Â The grant discussion starts around 23:00, but the whole episode is excellent.</li>
<li>Finally, Zach noted that they try to emulate the quality and style of <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/" target="_blank">EconTalk</a>, a podcast which has literally transformed how I see the world, and thus highly recommend.</li>
<li>Oh, and it's fun to listen to as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Update (6/5/2013): Listening through the archives, I discovered that <a href="http://www.weeklyweinersmith.com/?p=68" target="_blank">the second episode of the podcast</a> is all about space exploration, NASA, and the economic/human incentives involved in all of them. Whelp, might as well pack up shop here.</p>
