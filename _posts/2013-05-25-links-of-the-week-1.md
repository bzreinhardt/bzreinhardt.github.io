<p> Saturday Space Stories!</p>
<p> Ordered from least to most probable:</p>
<p>Through some <a href="http://www.space.com/21311-battlestar-galactica-flight-simulator-can-spin-any-direction-video.html" target="_blank">excellent mechanical design</a>, you can now imagine that you’re in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica" target="_blank">Battlestar Galactica</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCwQTkr-ZBk" target="_blank">space battle</a> with your stomach as well as your brain.</p>
<p>Verdict: while the simulator is a very cool real thing, close quarters space combat with robots-that-have-evolved-into-people while searching for a new homeworld is rather unlikely.</p>
<p>Stratolaunch and Orbital Sciences are working on a <a href="http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/05/stratolaunch-orbital-air-launch" target="_blank">much larger version of the Pegasus rocket</a> that might even be able to launch humans. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_rocket" target="_blank">current Pegasus</a> launches from several thousand feet in the air (carried by a plane) as opposed to the ground, like most rockets.  Although expensive for its weight, it allows for much more versatility in the launch timing and orbit placement: if there’s a storm in Florida (or wherever the launch pad happens to be), instead of scrubbing the launch, the plane can just fly somewhere else. Unfortunately, it can only handle small payloads … for now. </p>
<p>Verdict:  Lots of CGI and not much else, but I am cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>Finally, a little bird told me that the details of <a href="http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/nasa-to-hold-public-forum-on-asteroid-retrieval-mission" target="_blank">this announcement</a> might be kind of awesome.</p>
<p>Verdict: Barring NASA’s budget being completely revoked in the next two weeks (not <b>entirely</b> out of the question) the announcement is definitely going to happen.</p>
