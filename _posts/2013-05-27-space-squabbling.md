<p>If you’ve been paying attention to space news recently, you’ll know there’s a lot of conflict in congress concerning the course that they want NASA to take. It’s like a bunch of small children fighting over a teddy bear – in the same way that the bear isn’t fun for anybody with its arms ripped off, NASA is useless when it is paralyzed by being told to undertake a slew of different directions.</p>
<p>Jeff Faust at the Space Review <a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2291/1" target="_blank">goes into details</a>, but here’s a quick summary of NASA’s directional conflicts:</p>
<ul>
<li>SLS vs. Commercial crew</li>
<li>Going to the Moon vs. Mars vs. an asteroid vs. capturing an asteroid and THEN going to it</li>
<li>Space science missions vs. earth science missions vs. manned missions</li>
</ul>
<p> It’s this last category that’s most concerning because it has space advocates at each other’s throats, as opposed to just politicians (from whom we wouldn’t expect any better.)</p>
<p> Everybody wants their own missions to be funded, and so <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/22/experts-cast-doubt-mars-mission-plans/" target="_blank">the space scientists attack the manned missions</a>,  the earth scientists attack the space scientists, and those in favor of manned space attack science missions. Embarrassingly, this last case i<a href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/04/06/columbus-vs-columbot/" target="_blank">ncludes myself.</a>  </p>
<p>The problem here is two-fold. The infighting both prevents a more holistic, productive approach to space exploration and focuses what should be excitement on negativity instead. </p>
<p>We shouldn’t look at money for one type of mission as stealing from another – space activities should be able to be more holistic, with developments used for one type of mission <b>contributing</b> to the rest. This is often not the case, but should be something to shoot for. </p>
<p>More importantly, by fighting over space exploration, all of us space geeks are missing the bigger point: we’re all on the same side.  It’s like the situation in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_ice_and_fire" target="_blank">A Song of Ice and Fire </a>(that’s the Game of Thrones series for you TV-show-only-folks):  the warring of the great houses while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Others_(A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire)#The_Others" target="_blank">the inhuman Others</a> gather in the North. </p>
<p>The Others are not the people who advocate different missions than those we’d prefer, but the plethora of people who oppose space exploration all together. </p>
