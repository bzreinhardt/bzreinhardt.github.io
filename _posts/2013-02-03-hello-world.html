<p>Rather than begin this blog with a manifesto, I’m going to (hopefully!) set a precedent for informative, to-the-point posts that are no longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>As with any blog, the primary objective here is to share my thoughts with you.  However, there isn’t exactly a plethora of aerospace/mechanical engineering graduate students with a degree in medieval history and a strong interest in economics and private enterprise.  My plan is to use this bizarre combination of perspectives to approach subjects from a direction well off of the beaten path.  Kind of like the platypuses of the idea world.</p>
<p>I will focus on the topic of space-exploration and engineering, but make no promises not to stray into ideas about science more broadly, the academic world of a graduate student or (horror!) random subjects that might be of interest.  There may be rants, but I will try to make them entertaining and useful – you have been warned!</p>
<p>And of course, dear reader, there is your entertainment to consider! If you wanted dry analysis or technical ramblings, you would be reading an academic journal right now.  <b>Cue half of the audience closing the window and opening up a nice, dense PDF.</b></p>
<p>I intend to share ideas that will inform, entertain, and hopefully spawn some hybridized thinking of your own.  And please comment or otherwise get in touch with me – closing the loop isn’t just useful in engineering systems!</p>
