<p>Today I wrote a<a href="http://www.spacecraftresearch.com/blog/?p=212" target="_blank"> quick post over on my lab blog a</a>bout a modeling tool I'm working with.</p>
<p>The program ties in with a bigger idea that my advisor put in my head (and I want to write more about later) - that we need to lower the barriers between having an awesome creative idea (something humans are very good at) and turning that idea into reality (something that computers could potentially become very good at.) Think<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=mbj3XSvDyw8#t=213" target="_blank"> Iron Man</a> or (more real world)<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=xNqs_S-zEBY" target="_blank"> Elon Musk.Â </a></p>
