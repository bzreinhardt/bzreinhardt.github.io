<p> “Wake up frosh! It’s Ditch Day!”</p>
<p> That cry, combined with the pounding of fists upon doors as seniors run down the halls, still elicits excitement in me now – 3 years after I graduated. It signals the beginning of Ditch Day, the most magical day of the year at Caltech. </p>
<p> I’ve written a <a href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/wake-up-frosh-its-ditch-day/" target="_blank">short description of Ditch Day</a>, but I’ve been inspired by <a href="http://ilyanep.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/what-is-caltechs-ditch-day/" target="_blank">Ilya’s detailed chronicle of his stack </a>(still ongoing.) This diversion will be part story and part ‘look at these cool things!’</p>
<p> T-minus 4 years to T-minus 9 Months:</p>
<p> When I first arrived at Caltech, I didn’t get what Ditch Day was, even after the concept had been explained to me. For the record, this is a common characteristic of almost all Caltech undergrad culture. I got just a taste of what Ditch Day during my first term at tech, when I was fully fooled (gullible frosh) by a fake Ditch Day – “huh” I thought, “I had heard that Ditch Day normally was third term, but I guess they like to keep us on our toes and change it up every few years.” A few awesome puzzles and a note to go back to bed whetted my appetite for the real thing.</p>
<p> And boy, were my expectations met.</p>
<p> I went on an Indiana Jones themed stack that involved deciphering a coded language, traversing a 3-D maze, finding a location by shining a light from the top of a staff, and an eight-course dinner to cap it off.</p>
<p> From then on, for the next three years (and after!), my brain was always whirring with possible puzzles, clues, and generally awesome things that could be used for a stack. In my heart lay the burning desire to make an epic stack, the likes of which had never been seen.</p>
<p> (Or at lest a really good stack, but if you’re going to shoot for epic, you have to frame the desire epically.)</p>
<p> To be continued….</p>
