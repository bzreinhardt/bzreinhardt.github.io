<p>Awesome Space Links of the Week 9/29</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkotter/2013/09/24/leadership-lessons-from-lego/#!" target="_blank">It has Legos, I couldn’t resist. </a>This advice actually applies pretty directly to research or any creative endeavor. Nothing new, but fun to see through the lens of Legos.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2375/1" target="_blank">Now here's a super Sunday I could get excited about </a>(sorry football) It's especially exciting because one of the secondary payloads was <a href="http://josephshoer.com/blog/2013/09/first-spacecraft-from-my-graduate-lab-launched/" target="_blank">CUSat – a satellite built by students at Cornell.</a></li>
<li>I wonder if there is anybody alive today with the skills to make <a href="http://www.chonday.com/Videos/the-writer-automaton" target="_blank">something like this</a>?</li>
<li><a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/08/03/a-comic-about-the-real-scientific-process.html/scienceragebig" target="_blank">To be fair, the 'do science' block of the top part basically encompasses the lower part.</a></li>
<li>And <a href="http://fora.tv/2013/09/22/the_maker_movement_manifesto" target="_blank">here’s a manifesto I</a> can get behind.</li>
<li>I feel like <a href="http://www.space.com/23055-moon-dust-beer-spacesuit.html" target="_blank">this says something profound about humanity.</a> What that is, I'll leave up to you.</li>
<li>The government shutdown - <a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/2013/10/03/senator-raises-concern-shutdown-wil-delay-maven" target="_blank">more arguments for why the government</a> shouldn't be in charge of <a href="http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/maven-given-emergency-exception-to-proceed-despite-shutdown" target="_blank">things that need to run on schedule</a>, like space launches.</li>
<li>When even universities <a href="http://www.space.com/23070-nasa-jet-propulsion-laboratory-government-shutdown.html" target="_blank">can run things more efficiently than the government</a>, that's saying something.</li>
<li>Happy <a href="http://www.worldspaceweek.org/wsw/index.php" target="_blank">Space Week</a> and <a href="http://www.space.com/23022-nasa-happy-birthday-government-shutdown.html" target="_blank">55th Birthday NASA</a></li>
<li>I think that <a href="http://www.space.com/23059-3d-printing-mars-colony.html" target="_blank">3-D printing </a>is actually a pretty constraining way to look at massless space exploration, but it's a start</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/2013/09/30/in-surprise-advance-announcement-2013-nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-to-higgs-boson/" target="_blank">I bet the real reason is because you don't have to give prize money to a subatomic particle</a></li>
