<p>I'm kind of rushed and sick but I wanted to leave this tidbit to brain-chew:</p>
<p>People are terrible at comparing things that are greater than two orders of magnitude apart. You can visualize $1 vs $10 vs $100 but try thinking about how much bigger $2000 is than $1 and it get kind of fuzzy.  </p>
<p>Same thing for length - how much bigger is a mile than an inch? You can certainly describe it mathematically, but an intuitive sense eludes us. </p>
<p>Examples of things that thwart human intuitions like orders and magnitude, probability, and statistics are fascinating. If you want to read an entire book about such things, you should check out the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=sr_1_1_ha?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373869165&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=thinking+fast+and+slow" target="_blank">Thinking Fast and Slow.</a></p>
