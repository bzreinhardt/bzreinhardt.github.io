<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/science/space/nasas-kepler-mended-but-may-never-fully-recover.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_20130816&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Sad news from today:</a> it looks like the planet-hunting Kepler telescope<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/15/space-kepler-idUSL2N0GG1S420130815?irpc=932" target="_blank"> has been permanently crippled by a mechanical malfunction.</a></p>
<p>I wonder what amount of the unfeasibility of sending a mission to fix Kepler is technical, what part is due to real cost-benefit analysis, and what part is just a lack of incentive to go to extremes to fix it. Perhaps it is cynical of me, but it seems like there might just be less incentive for a government agency to try to fix their malfunctioning technology than if it were owned by a private entity.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure the actual engineers working to fix Kepler, gave it 110% and worked until their eyes bled (figuratively, I hope) but I certainly haven’t heard any congressmen make a peep about spending money to aid the effort.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s a false comparison, but Kepler reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon" target="_blank">Deepwater Horizon</a> – malfunctioning assets worth hundreds of millions.  However, the reputation of a private company facing legal sanctions rested on Deepwater Horizon. None of this is the case for Kepler, and thus much less is being done to fix it.</p>
<p> It seems to me like a mission to repair Kepler would itself be in line with NASA’s goals. It would demonstrate new technological capabilities and restore functionality to a valuable science asset. Both the private and public sectors have been taking steps towards on-orbit-servicing. This is a chance for NASA to do exactly what (at least I think) NASA should do – blaze a trail for completely new space capabilities through missions that are far too risky for private companies.  </p>
<p> On top of the other benefits, rescuing Kepler could be a smashing PR piece. Kepler just needs to be portrayed as the poor lost child, and the outpouring of public sentiment might be similar to <a href="http://xkcd.com/695/" target="_blank">when Spirit became stuck.</a>  Who wouldn’t support heroic NASA, saving a kid that fell down a gravity well?</p>
