<p>If you were to ask an Icelandic sheep farmer freezing in his longhouse 500 years ago: "hey, will those rainy mountains and geysers make your descendants wealthy?" he would have said "you're crazy. sheep and fish are natural resources, rainy mountains just get in the way." </p>
<p>Fast forward 500 years. Those rainy mountains provide tons of fast-flowing water, which can be turned into something the sheep farmer couldn't even imagine - cheap electricity. This electricity can be used to smelt something else the sheep farmer didn't know existed - pure aluminum. This aluminum is valuable because it enables thousands of technologies that - you guessed it - the sheep farmer could barely have imagined.  </p>
<p>With this story and <a href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/12/29/never-say-never/">many, many like it,</a> I always find it surprising that many people still say "yes, well NOW we know what the limits are and should really slow down." </p>
