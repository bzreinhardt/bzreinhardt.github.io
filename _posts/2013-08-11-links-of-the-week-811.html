<p>Sunday Stories (Saturday Stories slightly time-shifted due to satellite and redwood filled backpacking)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.space.com/22209-curiosity-s-first-year-on-mars-in-2-minutes-time-lapse-video.html" target="_blank">Cool curiosity compilation</a> - I would recommend you have your volume off.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.space.com/22235-japan-launches-talking-space-robot-astronaut.html" target="_blank">I'm sure having huge anime eyes was one of the top engineering requirements</a>
</li>
<li>You know the best way to streamline <a href="http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/mccarthy-introduces-soars-act-to-streamline-commercial-spaceflight-regs" target="_blank">a government regulatory process?</a> Not have one</li>
<li>On the same topic: <a href="http://spaceref.biz/2013/08/congressman-kevin-mccarthy-introduces-bill-to-streamline-commercial-spaceflight.html" target="_blank">Hey look guys! I made a bill that makes more rules to get rid of stupid rules that should have existed in the first place.</a> Also, I like how reporters don't actually read bills themselves anymore, but just trust the author on what its contents are.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Argh - <a href="http://www.space.com/22238-mars-one-private-colony-volunteers-meeting.html" target="_blank">It feels so over the crazy line</a>, but so crazy that I want it to be a thing</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/disruptions-rather-than-time-computers-might-become-panacea-to-hurt" target="_blank">"No I will not pay to get your brain hooked directly to the internet."</a> "but dad, everybody is doing it"
</li>
<li><a href="http://spaceref.com/missions-and-programs/nasa/japanese-vehicle-delivers-new-hardware-for-nasas-robotic-refueling-mission.html" target="_blank">But they need to approach it safely first</a> ;-) *cough* shameless research plug *cough*
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24002-poor-sleep-makes-food-more-appealing.html#.UgP-UGTEo56" target="_blank">Sure - sleep is better than not sleep</a> - but how much sleep is 'sufficient?' Complex science is bad at making recommendations on the margins.
</li>
<li>I was part of<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=zc0dyTWa3fU&amp;t=167" target="_blank"> this! </a>Admittedly, as a stenographer...</li>
</ul>
