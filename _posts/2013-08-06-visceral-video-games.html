<p>Alright – the last post about visceral incentives for a bit, but I have incredibly strong bipolar feelings about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=trueview-instream&amp;v=QOdW1OuZ1U0" target="_blank">this Playstation advertisement. </a></p>
<p> On the one hand it engages me and makes me really excited! Who doesn’t want to be a classy, fireball-throwing, raging badass.</p>
<p> On the other hand, it directs that human visceral desire for greatness and awesome towards playing video games.  Video games aren’t necessarily bad – I just wonder: what could be accomplished on the margin if that energy and desire for greatness were targeted towards the physical world *cough cough * space *cough cough * instead?</p>
<p>I feel like we’re progressing towards one of <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">three </span> four far futures:</p>
<p>1)   We are all wiped out, either by nature or ourselves.</p>
<p>2)   We become a spacefaring species and spread to the stars</p>
<p>3)   We turn inwards, our brains experiencing amazing “realities” of our own creation</p>
<p>4)   A future that is two blocks over and down the street from where my imagination can see</p>
<p>The visceral appeal of that advertisement makes me feel like (3) is the most likely. Is this bad? Not particularly, but it isn't the option that I will strive to make into a reality.</p>
