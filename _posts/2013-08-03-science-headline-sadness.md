<p>With (unedited) headlines like these, no wonder most people don’t find science worthwhile:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Physicists at the University of California at Berkeley are putting Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity to the test with an experiment using electrons.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<b>Study: Large volcanoes can produce fast-moving magma</b>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Here is my version of them that hopefully actually conveys meaning and interest:</p>
<p> “UC Berkely scientists conduct further experiments to verify a cornerstone of modern physics.” </p>
<p> “A new study shows that large volcanoes can produce fast magma, a previously unknown capability.”</p>
<p> Maybe my headlines aren’t the best, but I also didn’t go to journalism school.</p>
