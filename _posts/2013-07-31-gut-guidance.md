<p>The NewSpace 2013 conference gave me a lot to think about, but more than anything, it hammered home the fact that while we would like to think otherwise, humans are driven by their visceral feelings.</p>
<p>At the conference, I listened to several talks and had many conversations where space exploration was thought of as “the cause.” What is belief in a cause except a visceral feeling of support for its goal?  Now, I happen to believe in this cause but unfortunately (in my mind) most people don’t.  A prevalent thought a the conference held that gaining mass support for space exploration was just a matter of convincing people to believe in the cause.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s not how it works.</p>
<p>Successful endeavors that require the support of many people are able to tap into visceral drives that are <em>already there</em>.   Just look at the support for infant NASA (which turns 55 today) – it was driven by nationalistic pride and fear of the Russians.</p>
<p>This one of the reasons why I am an advocate of private space flight – if space exploration becomes profitable, it can harness the might that is the self-interested pursuit of wealth. While that might seem distasteful, I see nothing wrong with it. In such a situation, everybody wins: those who just want wealth can make money through their investments, and I get to satisfy my visceral desire to see humanity spread to the stars.</p>
