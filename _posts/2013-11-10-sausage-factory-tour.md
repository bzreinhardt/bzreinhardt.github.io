<p><a href="http://www.spacecraftresearch.com/blog/?p=234" target="_blank">I'm really interested in opening the doors to the sausage factory that is research (at least a little.) </a></p>
<p>Something I don't think I emphasized enough in the post or on this blog is how useful and important feedback is to research, writing, thinking ... and everything else. So if anything I say sparks a thought or two, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me.</p>
