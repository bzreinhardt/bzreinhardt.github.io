<p>The changing component of the magnetic fields that produce eddy currents can come from two sources: a relative velocity between the field and the target or change in the strength of the field itself. For a number of reasons the bulk of EC actuation research has focused on the latter mechanism. Time-varying electromagnets are easier to both analyze and implement.</p>
<p>However, two motors spinning magnets to createÂ eddy-currents through moving magnetic fields may be able to achieve something that is much harder with electromagnets: attraction AND repulsion without a complicated scheme.</p>
<p>The motor-magnet actuator says to the plate: "come here"</p>

<p>Combine that with "sashay left and right"</p>
