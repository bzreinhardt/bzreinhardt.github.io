<p>I wrote a <a href="http://www.spacecraftresearch.com/blog/?p=226" target="_blank">new post over at the SSDS blog</a> about the value of engineering research on technologies that may not yet be feasible.</p>
<p>Basically, this is how technological tipping points happen - once we figure out that a technology is <em>possible,</em> it lies<em> </em>dormant until developments in other fields make it <i>feasible, </i>at which point it bursts into usefulness.</p>
