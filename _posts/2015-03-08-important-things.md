Smarter, Faster, Stronger, Higher. 

I realized that these four words summarize the most important things for humanity.

Smarter: making the shared extra-brain that is the internet and computation more useful.

Faster: making things that move us and other things move faster or in new ways.

Stronger: making energy easier to harness, store, and distribute.

Higher: Ad Astra!
