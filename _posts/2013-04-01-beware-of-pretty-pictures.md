<p>On space.com today, one of these reports is not like the others:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.space.com/20449-swiss-private-rocket-plane-2017.html">http://www.space.com/20449-swiss-private-rocket-plane-2017.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.space.com/20461-russia-moon-robots-missions.html">http://www.space.com/20461-russia-moon-robots-missions.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.space.com/20452-scotland-first-satellite-launching-soon.html">http://www.space.com/20452-scotland-first-satellite-launching-soon.html</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.space.com/20449-swiss-private-rocket-plane-2017.html" target="_blank">first</a> <a href="http://www.space.com/20461-russia-moon-robots-missions.html" target="_blank">two</a> are articles describing a space mission or technology concept accompanied by a slew of excellent computer-generated graphics, an impressive description and an ambitious timeline. These hyped-up but meat-lacking reports are a strong indicator of being over the tinfoil hat line in the bad way. While I’m in favor of crazy ideas, portrayals of them as straightforward sure-shots without caveats is similar to crying wolf: it makes people more cynical towards way-out-there ideas with actual substance behind them. </p>
<p>Contrast those to the <a href="http://www.space.com/20452-scotland-first-satellite-launching-soon.html" target="_blank">last article</a>, which shows a bunch of smiling researchers around a real-life piece of technology. While the actual mission (and graphics) might not be as ambitious and flashy, reports like this one are the real substance worth excitement.</p>
<p> In short, beware of pretty pictures. </p>
