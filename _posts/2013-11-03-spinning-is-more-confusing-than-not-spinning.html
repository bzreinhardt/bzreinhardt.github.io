<p>I've come to value the power of human intuition more and more over time, but there are three (off the top of my head - I know there are more) situations where our intuition completely breaks down. In these cases, I think the lens of math/science truly shines:</p>
<p>Statistics</p>
<p>Probability</p>
<p>Rotating Reference Frames</p>
