<p>Sometimes I don't need to justify space exploration - space will just speak for itself (with a little help from NASA)</p>

<p>In a similar vein, I also highly recommend the <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/" target="_blank">Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)</a> if you haven't seen it before. The daily pictures motivate me each morning just as much as my coffee.</p>
