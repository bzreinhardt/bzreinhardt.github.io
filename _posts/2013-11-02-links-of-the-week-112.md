<p>Saturday (Mostly Space) Stories!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.space.com/23415-astronomy-data-overload-astroinformatics-project.html" target="_blank">Big Data in Spaaaaace</a></li>
<li>I think it’s important to investigate the sausage factory of science…after the results have been declared satisfactory. <a href="http://www.newspacejournal.com/2013/10/27/dream-chaser-suffers-landing-gear-failure-on-first-free-flight/" target="_blank">Scrutiny during the process </a>extends deadlines indefinitely – too much pressure to get it right on the first try. It’s not an experiment if there’s not a possibility of failure.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2391/1" target="_blank">Balloons to space are definitely cool,</a> but I think this illustrates how bad the government is at regulating. To actually stay in space, you need a lot more horizontal velocity than vertical, so I wouldn’t call this a launch vehicle at all.</li>
<li>I'm tempted to be extreme and say we shouldn't be allowed to <a href="http://spaceref.com/mars/mars-sample-return-container.html" target="_blank">get Martian samples</a> unless they're in human hands</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24758935" target="_blank">I, for one, salute our incumbent bouncing overlords.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/education/as-interest-fades-in-the-humanities-colleges-worry.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;smid=fb-nytimes" target="_blank">We need to separate learning a trade and training to learn</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/2013/11/01/another-plea-to-get-the-politics-out-of-space" target="_blank">The only way to truly get politics out of space is to get space out of politics</a></li>
</ul>
