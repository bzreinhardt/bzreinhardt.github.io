<p>Saturday Stories!</p>
<p>Awesome Space Links of the Week 10/5</p>
<ul>
<li>Bureaucracy vs. progress and efficiency: <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/10/04/229224964/episode-489-the-invisible-plumbing-of-our-economy?ft=1&amp;f=93559255&amp;utm_medium=App.net&amp;utm_source=PourOver" target="_blank">round one million</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/95503cc8-2f6f-11e3-8b7e-00144feab7de.html?ftcamp=crm/email/2013108/nbe/Aerospace/product&amp;siteedition=intl#axzz2hBNFghWG" target="_blank">Does it still count as a private company if it furloughs employees when the government shuts down?</a></li>
<li>I sure hope <a href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/robotics/robot-targets-jellyfish-and-shreds-them-131003.htm" target="_blank">they don't spit</a> the <a href="http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/can-dead-jellyfish-sting.html" target="_blank">shredded jellyfish</a> back out again</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24400101" target="_blank">Now, can we 3D print it in space?</a></li>
<li>Nobody seems to address the issue that humans have finite bandwidth and we will either have to <a href="http://fora.tv/2013/09/22/age_of_contextthe_future_of_consumer_electronics" target="_blank">spend all of our time monitoring sensor data </a>or computers (and by extension whoever programmed them) will be deciding what is or is not important</li>
<li>Depressing Bureaucracy is depressing - <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24363-worlds-first-malaria-vaccine-on-course-for-2015.html#.UlTNTvLlnpo" target="_blank">file in 2014, could be on the market as soon as 2016</a> - how long is that in lives?</li>
<li><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131009-diamonds-saturn-jupiter-planet-science-space/" target="_blank">More evidence that space is full of bizarre unknown unknowns </a>that we won't even discover unless we go there</li>
<li>I really hope there will be a diagram <a href="http://cafehayek.com/2013/10/i-airplane.html" target="_blank">like this</a> for spacecraft one day. Preferably with the parts made on different planets.</li>
<li>I'm intrigued by how good MIT is at <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/10/06/self-assembling-robots/" target="_blank">pitching their science</a>.</li>
<li>The tale of the <a href="http://www.newspacejournal.com/2013/10/12/grasshopper-flies-again-sets-new-altitude-record/" target="_blank">world's coolest inverted pendulum</a> continues</li>
<li>Ugh. There aren't borders in space. I can vaguely understand not wanting to share could-be-turned-into-a-missile technologies, <a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/2013/10/10/kepler-conference-caught-in-a-chinese-puzzle/" target="_blank">but a conference to analyze astronomy data</a>...really?</li>
</ul>
