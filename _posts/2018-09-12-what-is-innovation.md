I've been asking the question "How do you accelerate innovations?"

The response from a very smart friend was "What do you mean by innovation?"

Innovation is a word that is both *fuzzy* and thrown around a lot. Not a good combination.

The best definition<sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> for innovation is from the book [Cycles of Innovation and Discovery](https://www.amazon.com/Cycles-Invention-Discovery-Venkatesh-Narayanamurti-ebook/dp/B01LWQWNMH/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536776701&sr=8-1&keywords=cycles+of+innovation+and+discovery&dpID=41gliQHODwL&preST=_SY445_QL70_&dpSrc=srch):

"The creation of new processes, products, or ideas that result in significant improvements in the world."

**New** - The new piece is important because there are many things that create improvements in the world and are not new. These things are valuable, just not innovations.

**Processes, Products, or Ideas** - It's important to not limit innovations to tools/products. New ways of thinking about the world are arguably even more powerful: see the scientific method. [Processes may be some of the most under-appreciated innovations](https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/).

**Significant improvements in the world** - Some definitions leave this out. Yes, it's fuzzy - what is "significant?" But there are many new things that are clearly not innovations. Like that great idea you had in the shower. Or the [onesie floor mop](https://www.amazon.com/BABYMOP-Helps-Cleaning-House-Rompers/dp/B00F99WO2Y). These things have not created significant improvements in the world. Not to diminish the experience of those five star onesie floor mop reviewers.
