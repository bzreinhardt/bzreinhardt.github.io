<p>The experiment of posting every day has been an awesome, exhausting, challenge. Like everybody I know of who's tried a post a day (except <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/" target="_blank">Tyler Cowen</a>) I can't keep it up. There comes a Â point where the benefits of keeping it up are outweighed by the costs.</p>
<p>I'm going to continue to post at least twice a week and also over on the <a href="http://www.spacecraftresearch.com/blog/" target="_blank">SSDS blog.</a></p>
<p>Additionally, I've decided to stick my toe into the twitterverse with the handle @ben_reinhardt.</p>
