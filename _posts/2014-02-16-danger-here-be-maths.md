<p>A description of the <a href="http://www.spacecraftresearch.com/blog/?p=538" target="_blank">latest research rabbit hole over at SSDS:</a> where could you put a ping pong ball on the outside of the ISS, let go, and have it stick thanks to orbital mechanics? There is math and pretty pictures.</p>
<p>It's also a test of $latex \LaTeX$ Â equations in wordpress. So far, so good.</p>
