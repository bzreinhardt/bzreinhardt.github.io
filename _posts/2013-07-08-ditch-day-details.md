<p>A busy weekend, while awesome, didn't leave me much quality blog-post-type-thinking time.</p>
<p>However I did discover an delightfully <a href="http://ilyanep.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/what-is-caltechs-ditch-day/" target="_blank">detailed description of Ditch Day</a> at Caltech written up by Ilya Nepomnyashchiy.  </p>
<p>I've briefly described Ditch Day <a href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/wake-up-frosh-its-ditch-day/" target="_blank">in the past</a>, and should probably emulate Ilya and write up a fun and detailed description of my stack in the future.  </p>
