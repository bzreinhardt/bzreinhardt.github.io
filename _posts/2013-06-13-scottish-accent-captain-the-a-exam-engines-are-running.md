<p>(scottish accent) Captain! The A-Exam engines are running at 110% I don't think think she can take it much longah!</p>
<p>Since I already have my historian hat on from yesterday, I wanted to quickly point out this fun new blog I discovered: http://askthepast.blogspot.com.  They dredge up advice from old (pre-18th century) books on doing every day things.</p>
<p>My historian-dar notes that there are no references, so it could all be made up, but its a fun read nevertheless.</p>
