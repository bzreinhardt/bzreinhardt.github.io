<p>One of the upshots of <a title="An (over?) abundance of awesome" href="http://benjaminreinhardt.wordpress.com/2013/06/19/an-over-abundance-of-awesome/" target="_blank">Monday’s post</a> is that NASA has kind of poor PR. A slew of factors contribute to this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Half of the news published about NASA focuses on congressional squabbling over funding and constant direction changes that make it look like it’s NASA’s fault.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>NASA has a ‘boy who cried wolf’ problem:  Exciting but vague announcements often drum up tons of anticipation for press conferences about breaking discoveries that then turns out to be quite a letdown. One salient example is the highly anticipated press conference regarding  “a discovery related to life on other planets” that was actually about earth bacteria that <a href="http://www.livescience.com/9046-microbe-eats-arsenic.html" target="_blank">incorporated arsenic into their DNA</a> – and even that was <a href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/biotechnology/bacteria-filters-arsenic-121004.htm" target="_blank">later disproven</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, the PR staffers aren’t the ones who are super excited and knowledgeable about all of the awesome projects – that would be the people too busy actually working on the projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>While NASA certainly has outreach departments, it would look bad for a government agency to be hiring top advertising talent to work there. It’s also illegal for NASA to explicitly advertise. And really, a government agency <b>shouldn’t</b> be spending taxpayer money on advertising. Yet, something needs to be done to change public opinion to encompass all of the awesome of space exploration.</p>
