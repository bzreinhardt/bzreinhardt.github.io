I like throwing out ideas. This doesn't mean I am wedded to them. Please push back

I want to be open to spontaneous interactions, but also don't like to be interrupted. If I have 2 headphones in, it means 'do not disturb' - <2 headphones = "lets talk!"

Unless you're afk, I really appreciate some acknowledgement that I sent you an email within 24 hours. It doesn't have to be an in-depth answer, but it's common courtesy to send a 'got your message, will get back to you soon'
