I'm Ben.
 
Sometimes, I act like a Spacecraft engineer ... when it's necessary. 
Other times, I act like a son, a friend, or a very large set of lungs.

My contact information is at the bottom of the page. I like hearing other people's ideas.

Everybody is busy, so to make scheduling a bit easier [here's my calendar.][cal]
