  <h1  id="arpa_model"><span >ARPA model</span></h1>
  <p ><span class=" 1  tiny">Note to the reader - I don&rsquo;t plan on broadcasting this piece widely. My hope is that a smaller number of people take it very seriously instead of a large number treating it as an interesting
      curiosity. Please do share with anyone who might appreciate it. Thank you!</span></p>
  <h2  id="abstract-ish"><span >Abstract-ish</span></h3>
  <p ><span >How can we enable more science fiction to become reality?</span></p>
  <p ><span >If you want to do something, it usually pays to study those who have done that thing successfully in the past. Asking </span><span class="emphasis">&ldquo;what is this outlier&rsquo;s production function?&rdquo;
    </span><span class="note_to_reader">can provide a starting point. </span></p>
  <p ><span >DARPA is an outlier organization in the world of turning science fiction into reality. Since 1958, it has been a driving force in the creation of weather satellites, GPS, personal computers, modern robotics, the
      internet, autonomous cars, and voice interfaces, to name a few. However, it is primarily limited to the domain of defense technology - there are DARPA-style ideas that are out of its scope. &nbsp;Which emulatable attributes contributed to
      DARPA&rsquo;s outlier results? </span><span>What does a</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span>domain-independent</span><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;ARPA model&rdquo; look like</span><span>? </span><span class="note_to_reader">Is it possible to
      build other organizations that generate equally huge results in other domains by riffing on that model?</span></p>
  <p ><span >Gallons of ink have been spilled describing </span><span class="emphasis">how</span><span >&nbsp;DARPA works</span><a id="footnote_source_1" class="internal-link" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">[1]</sup></a><span >,
      but </span><span>in a nutshell here is</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span >how DARPA works.</span><span >&nbsp;Around 100 </span><span class="emphasis">program managers (PMs)</span><span
      >&nbsp;with ~5 year appointments create and run programs to pursue high-level visions like &ldquo;actualize the idea of man-comp</span><span>uter symbiosis.&rdquo; In these programs they fund researchers at universities and both
      big and small companies to do research </span><span >projects</span><span>&nbsp;of different sizes. Collectively, groups working on projects are called </span><span >performers. </span><span>Top-level</span><span
      >&nbsp;authority lies with a </span><span class="emphasis">Director </span><span >who ultimately reports to the Secretary of Defense. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA has an incredibly powerful model for innovation in defense research, and I believe an abstract &#39;ARPA model&#39; could yield similar results in other domains. In this piece I&rsquo;ll explain in detail why
      DARPA works. I&rsquo;ll use that description to feel out and describe to the best of my ability a platonic ARPA model. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll also distill some of the model&rsquo;s implications for potential riffs on the model. Incidentally,
      I&rsquo;m working on just such an imitator, and in future essays, I&rsquo;ll explain why this model could be incredibly powerful when executed in a privately-funded context.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="  bold2">How to use this document</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">This document acts more like a collection of atomic notes than a tight essay - a DARPA-themed tapas if you will. The order of the sections is more of a guideline than a law so feel free to skip around. &nbsp;
      &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p ><span >There are three hierarchical pieces for different levels of time and interest: an</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#h.rd7cknv5ecn6">outline</a></span><span >, a
    </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#distillation">distillation</a></span><span >, and the </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#h.nbyw8g2b67uk">full work</a></span><span >. </span><span class="note_to_reader">The
      distillation is meant to capture and compress the main points of the full work. Each internally links to the corresponding section one level deeper so if you want more info and nuance you can get it. </span></p>

      pattern that the abstract qualities that make &ldquo;great talent&rdquo; in different high-variance industries boils down to the ability to successfully make things happen under a lot of uncertainty. Given that pattern, the people who would

      impossible and what it would take to make them possible. The PMs host </span><span class="quote">performer days</span><span >&nbsp;- small private conferences for all the people working on different pieces of the program where
      performers can exchange ideas on what is working, what isn&rsquo;t working, and build connections that don&rsquo;t depend on the PM. &nbsp;</span><span class="link"><a

      surrounded by smart, opinionated people the easy option is to either 100% accept what they&rsquo;re saying because it&rsquo;s eloquent and well-thought through or reject it outright because it sounds crazy or goes against your priors. Thinking
      for yourself allows you to avoid these traps. PMs need to be curious because building a complete picture of a discipline requires genuine curiosity to ask questions nobody else is asking. A large ego would lead to a program manager imposing
      their will on every piece of the program, killing curiosity and the benefits of top down problems and bottom up solutions.</span></p><a id="id.5w2nanq7fk3g"></a>

      let DARPA bypass normal government hiring rules and procedures. Hiring flexibility is important because PMs are the sort of people who are in high demand, so they may be unwilling to jump through hoops. Bureaucracies ensure consistency through
      rules - minimal bureaucracy means there are no safeguards against hiring a terrible program manager so the principle that &lsquo;A players hire A players and B players hire C players&rsquo; is incredibly important. &nbsp;</span></p><a

      Transience can inculcate PMs against the temptation to play it safe or play power games because there&rsquo;s only one clear objective - make the program work. You&rsquo;re out regardless of success or failure. Explicitly temporary roles can
      incentivize people with many options to join because they can have a huge impact, and then do something else. There&rsquo;s no implicit tension between the knowledge that most people will leave eventually and the uncertainty about when that
      will be. Regular program manager turnover means that there is also turnover in ideas.</span></p><a id="id.2unts64nylyt"></a>

      class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;There are unique benefits though. It offers an outlet for people frustrated with the conservative nature of academia. The prospect of getting to control a lot of money without a ton of oversight appeals to some people.
      Patriotism is definitely a factor, and hard to replicate outside of a government. Being a PM can gain you the respect of a small, elite group of peers who will know what you did. Finally, there may be a particular technological vision they want
      to see out in the world and DARPA gives them the agency to make it happen in unique ways.</span></p>

      so it&rsquo;s important to ask: How does DARPA incentivize people not to abuse opacity? DARPA&rsquo;s small size and flat structure enable peer pressure to work in positive ways. Finite tenures either make people want to utterly crush it or not
      care at all. The former happens when you empower driven program managers.</span></p><a id="id.czz67wjguqsp"></a>

      money like Congress that has many opinions exacerbates the incentive to &lsquo;play it safe.&rsquo; Committees lead to median results and ensuring that any action you take is acceptable to a committee is almost as bad as the committee
      determining those actions. &nbsp;An opinionated director is the lynchpin keeping DARPA focused on long-term ideas that nobody is asking for (yet.) At several points in its history, the director went to bat to keep DARPA from being dissolved or
      absorbed into the military as a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; R&amp;D organization.</span></p><a id="id.xjakhgsx45gv"></a>

      as &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; idea generation - often creating the idea for the program and soliciting project ideas from the community. In other ways PMs act as a &lsquo;top down&rsquo; force by pushing researchers to work on a well-defined
      problem. DARPA completely sidesteps the always-important question &ldquo;is top-down or bottom-up better?&rdquo; by doing both. </span></p><a id="id.55g5paanz138"></a>

      lasts longer than any individual but memory of any specific programs dies out quickly. There is only one PM running any given program and people pay much more attention to their own work than other people&rsquo;s. This transient memory about
      specific ideas allows them to be judged on their own merits instead of dealing with baggage from the past. The ability to revisit ideas enables DARPA to explore &lsquo;unexploited Leonardo Ideas&rsquo; - good ideas that are before their

      program they&rsquo;re working on and you can&rsquo;t have slackers. Small size also helps keep PM quality high by removing pressure to hire a lot of people. </span></p><a id="id.wclf14dol3ft"></a>

      who are just in it for the money and treat the role as &lsquo;just a job.&rsquo; On the other hand, the low pay may weed out people who have some lower bound on what they think they&rsquo;re worth. </span></p><a id="id.fejti265ymeh"></a>

      emerged. In the private sector, Google ATAP is DARPA-esque enough to learn lessons about what not to do from and Wellcome Leap appears to be a full-on health-focused implementation of the ARPA model.</span></p><a id="id.ytlduzi45dp8"></a>

  <p ><span class=" 1">This document &nbsp;is not meant to be a primer on </span><span class="emphasis">how</span><span class=" 1">&nbsp;the ARPA model works or a history of DARPA, although it draws on both.</span><span
      >&nbsp;People have written thousands of words on both</span><a id="footnote_source_4" class="internal-link" href="#footnote_4"><sup class="mark">[4]</sup></a><span >. </span><span >This document is </span><span
      class="emphasis">not</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;meant to be an unbiased presentation of facts or argue for a general thesis about the world or institutions (though it hints at some.) The goal of this analysis is to acknowledge that DARPA is a
      massive outlier, figure out which emulatable attributes contributed to its outlier results, and synthesize them with the explicit intention of creating more organizations that can enable more outlier results. More than anything else, this
      analysis is meant to guide my own action, &nbsp;not to be tossed into the sea of the internet for some unknown policy maker to act on (though that would be nifty.) </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">The nature of outliers means that you can&rsquo;t do a data-based analysis. Perhaps controversially, I think it&rsquo;s foolish to try to find patterns among outliers because outliers are outliers in </span><span
      class="emphasis">different</span><span >&nbsp;ways except in the most broad strokes. Instead, I dig into the characteristics &nbsp;that seem distinctive and ask why they might lead to outlier results. At the end of the day, this is
      storytelling. But stories are powerful. Of course, it&rsquo;s easy to take this approach too far and create a story about how </span><span class="emphasis">anything</span><span >&nbsp;weird about an outlier contributed to their success:
      &ldquo;Steve Jobs only wore one outfit which is important because it allowed him to have EXTREME FOCUS.&rdquo; I try to avoid the lure of story first by focusing on why the pieces lead to outlier performance </span><span class="emphasis">in
      combination</span><span >. M</span><span >any people who try to replicate outliers fail by picking and choosing the pieces they want to replicate. Second, the goal here is to figure out how to make something that
    </span><span class="emphasis">works,</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;not create a cute theory. I hope that the desire to enable action incentivized me to be intellectually honest. </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Is it foolish to try to replicate outliers? Every outlier is an outlier in a different way, so on its surface it seems like the answer is yes. Concretely, many people have set out to build the next Apple by
      emphasizing design and perfectionism and fallen flat on their face. People have even tried to replicate DARPA. </span><span class="link"><a
        href="https://www.iarpa.gov/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591636119678000">IARPA</a></span><span >, </span><span class="link"><a

  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">There are three mistakes you could make when trying to replicate outliers:</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">1. Cherry picking characteristics without understanding why they&rsquo;re significant or the magnitude of their effects</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">2. Copying at such an abstract level as to be useless</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">3. Trying to clone an organization whole cloth</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader"></span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Instead of trying to copy an outlier exactly or only in broad strokes, the goal should be to deeply understand how it works and then riff on that understanding for your own situation. If it helps, imagine a Jenga
      tower made up of attributes of the outlier. While not all the attributes are important, many are, in an interconnected way. We need to poke each block and see which ones are structural. &nbsp;While few people have become outliers by copying
      other outliers, plenty of outliers have become outliers by </span><span class="emphasis">apprenticing</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;to other outliers (Ben Graham and Warren Buffet, Edison and Ford, etc.) You could think of an outlier analysis of an
      organization as a type of organizational apprenticeship.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">The evidence also suggests that while it&rsquo;s hard, replicating outlier success is not impossible. IARPA arguably has been reasonably successful - David Wineland&rsquo;s Nobel prize winning quantum computing
      work was sponsored by IARPA and I suspect that IARPA is positioned to be to quantum computing what ARPA was to personal computing. &nbsp;Since</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#id.zhrptighkpj8">&nbsp;the ARPA execution framework boils
        down to showing that thing is not impossible, showing that thing is possible, and then making that thing possible</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">, the IARPA proof point that riffing on the ARPA model is not impossible is a good first step.</span>
  </p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">I lean heavily on internal linking within this writeup. Partially the links are an attempt to illustrate how interconnected the different components are in order to avoid the cherry-picking failure case. To avoid
      cargo-culting abstraction I try to explain </span><span class="emphasis">why</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;each component matters, erring on the side of speculation rather than on the side of &ldquo;just because.&rdquo; These deep interlinked
      explanations will hopefully enable myself and others to see where components could be changed to adjust for different applications without copying the whole thing whole cloth and expecting it to work. </span></p>

      well, so you can just dig into the ones that make you go &#x1f914;</span></p>
  <p ><span >Mini Glossary. </span><span class="note_to_reader">I will also try to avoid terms of art and acronyms wherever possible. There are a few I think are useful to keep from this one paragraph description of how DARPA works:

  <p ><span >Around 100 </span><span >program managers (PMs)</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span >with ~5 year appointments create and run </span><span
      >programs</span><span >&nbsp;to pursue high-level visions like &ldquo;actualize the idea of man-computer symbiosis.&rdquo; In these programs they fund researchers at universities and both big and small companies
      to do research </span><span >projects</span><span >&nbsp;of different sizes. Collectively, groups working on projects are called </span><span >performers</span><span class="emphasis">. </span><span

  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">I play fast and loose with the term &ldquo;risk&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s mostly as a shorthand for &ldquo;chance of not achieving goals.&rdquo; </span></p>

  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Every single description of the ARPA model agrees that it&rsquo;s all about the program managers.</span></p>

  </p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">PMs don&rsquo;t get much structure when they&rsquo;re designing and executing programs. The closest thing to a &nbsp;&lsquo;program design framework&rsquo; I could tease out of former DARPA PMs is that they
      r</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#the_&lsquo;framework&rsquo;_darpa_pms_use_to_create_a_program_is_to_mentally_model_the_tech_council">oughly model the tech council in their heads and organize their activities around answering the questions that &lsquo;model tech council&rsquo; would throw at them</a></span><span
      >. As we already noted</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_a_systemic_biases">, the best DARPA program managers are the ones who can look at an entire literature in an area and notice a systemic bias</a></span><span
      >, which involves a very strong ability to think for yourself and go up and down the ladder of abstraction in an unstructured environment. To throw some more suitcase-handle words into the mix PMs need to be good communicators and
      coordinators</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager&rsquo;s_job_is_focused_network_building">&nbsp;because so much of their jobs is building networks. </a></span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">There&rsquo;s a pattern that the abstract qualities that make &ldquo;great talent&rdquo; in different high-variance industries boils down to the ability to successfully make things happen under a lot of uncertainty.
      DARPA PMs strongly pattern match against that description. Two conclusions from that observation: </span></p>
  <ol  ="1">
    <li class=" 2"><span class=" 1">The people who would make good DARPA PMs would also make good hedge fund analysts, first employees at startups, etc. so digging into </span><span class="link"><a

        other high-variance industry. </span></li>
    <li class=" 2"><span class="note_to_reader">When &lsquo;talent&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t code for &lsquo;specialized training&rsquo; it means the role or industry has not been systematized. Therefore, despite all the talk here and elsewhere about &lsquo;the
        ARPA model&rsquo; we must keep in mind that we may be attributing more structure to the process than actually exists.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <h3  id="darpa_program_managers_pull_control_and_risk_away_from_both_researchers_and_directors"><span >DARPA Program managers pull control and risk away from both researchers and directors</span></h3>
  <h4  id="control"><span >Control</span></h4>
  <p ><span >PMs pull control away from directors by having only one official checkpoint before launching programs and pull control away from performers through their ability to move money around
      quickly.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span >Control over direction and goals lies on a spectrum between </span><span class="emphasis">performers</span><span >&nbsp;- the people actually executing on the research and building
      with their own two hands - and </span><span class="emphasis">directors</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;- the people who run the innovation organization, be it a VC firm or DARPA.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">On the performer control end of the spectrum are organizations like</span><span class="link"><a  href="https://www.hhmi.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591636119684000">&nbsp;Howard
        Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;that in essence say &ldquo;ok performers - here&rsquo;s a bunch of money - go for it!&rdquo; </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">On the other end of the spectrum, director control looks like NASA&rsquo;s manned space program where the President has direct input into its direction. (Which is why NASA comes up with a 10 year plan every 8
      years.)</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Both ends of the control spectrum can lead to great results in the right situation. Performer control is effective for true exploratory research where you can&rsquo;t do better than someone with good intuition
      &nbsp;playing around. Director control is effective in scenarios like the Apollo Program or Manhattan Project, where you need a massive amount of resources and alignment from wildly different organizations like Congress, academia, the military,
      and companies.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">In a way DARPA PMs add a second axis to the control spectrum, pulling control away from both the performers and the directors. PMs pull control away from directors by having only </span><span class="link"><a
         class="internal-link" href="#every_program_at_darpa_is_intensely_technically_scrutinized_by_the_tech_council">one official checkpoint before launching the programs</a></span><span >&nbsp;and pull control away from performers through </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#h.1bfcc43kzfd4">their
        ability to move money around quickly</a></span><span >. It is relatively easy for DARPA PMs to re-deploy funding while it&rsquo;s hard for someone to pull funding from the program manager. The ARPA model doesn&rsquo;t fall
      neatly into a bucket of &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; or &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; but instead the PMs enable DARPA to do </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_does_multiple_levels_of_top-down_problem_generation_and_bottom-up_solution_generation">multiple levels of top-down problem generation and bottom-up solution
        generation</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">.</span></p>
  <h4  id="risk"><span >Risk</span></h4>
  <p ><span class=" 1">In addition to concentrating control, program managers also concentrate risk. The program manager ideally creates a program where the risk lies in the synthesis of relatively low risk projects. This approach is
      different from either a normal funding agency or VC portfolio approach where the performers bear the most risk and those risks are aggregated into a portfolio. &nbsp;</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_pms_use_seedling_projects_to_&lsquo;acid_test&rsquo;_the_riskiest_pieces_of_a_program_idea">DARPA PMs use
        seedling programs to &lsquo;acid test&rsquo; the riskiest pieces of a program idea</a></span><span >, so going into the main program, they should be pretty confident that what they&rsquo;re paying performers to do is possible.

      numbers on program failure rates, it&rsquo;s undoubtedly much higher than 10%. There are no great ways to compare to grants, but an &nbsp;NSF program designed to support &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; research had a ~10% success rate (where success
      was defined as producing transformative research.) High project success rates and low program success rates suggests that Program Managers are able to shift risk to the program level. Why does this matter? Shifting the risk from the performers
      to the program enables DARPA to tackle systemic problems where other models cannot.</span></p>

  <p ><span class=" 1">The idea of </span><span class="emphasis">focused</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;networking is important. DARPA program managers have a clear purpose for building the network - first to generate a clear target in an area,
      then to solicit paths towards the target, and then to make sure that the people who are executing on those paths know about each other so small adjustments to the plan can happen as frictionlessly as possible. It is easy to network in an
      indeterminate way, hoping that the connections you make will be useful one day. Many people go about networking in this way.</span></p>

  <p ><span class=" 1">In the first step - showing that a thing is not impossible, PMs need to find and become friends with (ideally) everybody who is working on ideas adjacent to the area where they want to have an impact to get a
      sense of what&rsquo;s possible. </span><span class="emphasis">Realistically, PMs are able to get this access because they bring the possibility of funding.</span><span >&nbsp;PMs also bring these people together in small groups to dig
      into which possibilities are not impossible and what it would take to make them possible. If the PM is doing their job well the people at the </span><span class="quote">workshops</span><span >&nbsp;won&rsquo;t already know each
      other and will continue to poke at ideas together on their own. The second step of the process - showing that a thing is in fact possible - leverages the network built during the first step to quickly do </span><span class="link"><a

  <p ><span class=" 1">During the third step of the process, PMs depend heavily on the network to send unique solutions their way. The PMs host </span><span class="quote">performer days</span><span class=" 1">&nbsp;- small private
      conference for all the people working on different pieces of the program. These conferences force people to talk about the work they&rsquo;re doing </span><span class="emphasis">while</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;they&rsquo;re doing it, which while
      uncomfortable, enables people to share solutions to tricky problems and form more connections. You could imagine this leading to problematic correlation between results because everybody would want to copy whatever the shiniest group is doing
      but at this point all the performers are locked in to whatever approach they&rsquo;re trying.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">You could think of DARPA PMs as playing the role of a manual </span><span class="link"><a

      the right time and give them an incentive to help each other out.</span></p>

      Today, a new professor needs about $1.5m to get going. Interestingly, I haven&rsquo;t seen any organizations devoted to seeding labs in a structured way beyond funding new professors who would have worked on those ideas anyway.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">PMs also build networks of people in different classes of organizations - government, academia, startups, and large companies. Connections between different verticals is one way that t</span><span class="link"><a
         class="internal-link" href="#a_list_of_changes_over_time">he DARPA has changed over time</a></span><span >&nbsp;- in the 1960&#39;s, large companies had much more academic R&amp;D arms and startups were barely a thing. By bringing academics, startups
      and big companies together, modern DARPA PMs are agents of </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#id.gcnqv44rtmr9">Safi Bahcall</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&rsquo;s admonition to &ldquo;Manage the Transfer not the Technology.&rdquo; That
      is, it&rsquo;s more important to manage the transfer of the technology between different groups and organizations, than it is to make sure that it is created in the first place. &nbsp;This shift in the PM role is important. Two reasons that we
      don&rsquo;t have more awesome sci fi shit that I&rsquo;ve seen over and over are 1) technology that needs actual manufacturing or high capital investment isn&rsquo;t able to jump the gap from a lab to a startup prototype or from a startup
      prototype to a real scalably manufactured product and 2) there are many pieces of technology that are amazing but don&rsquo;t warrant an entire VC backed startup on their own. It seems like building connections between different organization
      classes while the technology is being built could address both problems. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">In a way, the program manager acts like a product manager in a tech company, talking to the customer and modeling their needs. For DARPA the military is the customer but the difference is that the
      &lsquo;product&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t something that can be purchased (TRL 9) but something that is proved out enough that other branches of the military will scale it up.</span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_pms_need_to_think_for_themselves,_be_curious,_and_have_low_ego"><span >DARPA PMs need to think for themselves, be curious, and have low ego</span></h3>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Yes, on its surface this sounds like a platitude, but because so much of the ARPA model revolves around program managers, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to dig into </span><span class="emphasis">why</span><span
      class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;the personality traits actually matter.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">PMs need to think for themselves because at the end of the day, everybody they talk to has only a piece of the puzzle so the PM needs to both put the pieces together and precisely argue for the feasibility of the
      final picture. When you are surrounded by smart, opinionated people the easy option is to either 100% accept what they&rsquo;re saying because it&rsquo;s eloquent and well-thought through or reject it outright because it sounds crazy or goes
      against your priors. Thinking for yourself allows you to avoid these traps.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">PMs need to be curious because building a complete picture of a discipline requires genuine curiosity to </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_a_systemic_biases">ask questions nobody else is
        asking.</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;Additionally, the &lsquo;serendipity hatch&rsquo; during program execution where there is always an open call for ideas means that a program manager needs to be open to random outside solutions. Many
      people falsely claim they are curious, but from my direct experience DARPA PMs will have an earnest discussion with people who approach them about the craziest ideas. </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Scientists working on DARPA programs usually describe PMs as funding &lsquo;their idea&rsquo; in a proud way. At the same time, people looking at a DARPA program from the outside describe the program as clearly
      the PMs idea. A high ego would lead to a program manager imposing their will on every piece of the program, killing curiosity and the benefits of </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_does_multiple_levels_of_top-down_problem_generation_and_bottom-up_solution_generation">top down problems and bottom up
        solutions</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">.</span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_is_incredibly_flexible_with_who_it_hires_to_be_program_managers"><span >DARPA is incredibly flexible with who it hires to be program managers</span></h3>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Unlike most government roles, there are no hard requirements on the sort of people who can be hired to be program managers, to the extent that there are legal provisions in place that let DARPA bypass normal
      government hiring rules and procedures. This is important because </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_&ldquo;talent&rdquo;_in_other_disciplines">PMs are the sort of people who are in high demand</a></span><span >, so you need the ability to get
      people right when they&rsquo;re available or work around their constraints. Additionally, the PM&rsquo;s ability to </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#the_best_darpa_program_managers_notice_a_systemic_biases">notice and call out systematic biases in a
        discipline</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;is an attribute that is likely to make them clash with established structures and thus not be as heavily credentialed.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Hiring flexibility is also important because the bar for program managers is very high and </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_employees_aren&rsquo;t_paid_very_much_compared_to_what_they_could_be">the compensation is pretty low for their level of skill
      </a></span><span class="note_to_reader">so it&rsquo;s just straight up hard to find people who would both be good at and willing to do the job. The only flexibility you have in that situation is on credentials and profile.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Bureaucracies ensure consistency through rules, so there are no safeguards against hiring a terrible program manager. The fact that there are no guard rails makes DARPA extremely dependent on the principle that
      &lsquo;A players hire A players and B players hire C players.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a double edged sword. One reason hiring rules exist is to fight people&rsquo;s tendency to hire people like themselves. That tendency leads to organizational
      inbreeding which DARPA has been subject to in the past.</span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years"><span >DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Explicitly temporary tours of duty may also be one way that DARPA is able to get amazing PMs where they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to otherwise. If you have many options in life, it&rsquo;s more palatable to go
      into a position that is explicitly designed around the expectation that you can have maximum impact in a few years and then go do something else.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The transient nature of program managers also makes them more immune to most of the effects of asymmetric career risk because there&rsquo;s only one clear objective - make the program work. They are still subject to
      the bias of giving grants disproportionately to people they trust. The familiarity bias is what pushes granting committees to give grants to well-established, known researchers. However, my hunch is that biases towards trust and exposure are
      more solvable problems than worrying about their ability to show that their money was &lsquo;well spent&rsquo;.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Abstractly, the </span><span class="emphasis">explicitly</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;temporary nature of program managers allows DARPA to maintain alignment with program managers because alignment between people
      playing different games can happen on finite time scales but rarely on infinite ones. Unlike many organizations there&rsquo;s no implicit tension between the knowledge that most people will leave eventually and the uncertainty about when that
      will be. </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">People and organizations are all playing some game that has different ways of gaining status and power. Maybe there&rsquo;s something about PM&rsquo;s transient nature that doesn&rsquo;t allow them to play
      long-term games or figure out how to game them. There&rsquo;s something to the fact that the program managers are not just transient, but they are transiently </span><span class="emphasis">changing games.</span><span >&nbsp;An academic
      who becomes a program manager isn&rsquo;t going to worry about publishing papers. A military officer who becomes a program manager isn&rsquo;t going to worry about impressing their direct superiors. </span><span class="link"><a

  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The transient nature of program managers was only codified in the 90&rsquo;s because program managers were sticking around for much longer than five years. This codification suggests that the transient nature of
      program managers is more than just a historical artifact.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Speculatively, there&rsquo;s something about a culture that knows people have an explicitly short tenure that might actually maintain quality. You see this in lab groups, (possibly military units?), and fraternities
      that maintain the same culture for decades. Intergenerational culture is like a standing wave. </span></p>
  <h3  id="why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?"><span >Why do people become DARPA Program managers?</span></h3>

        class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">Patriotism - many PMs see the role as a way to serve their country. Obviously, this option isn&rsquo;t available for implementations of the ARPA model that aren&rsquo;t associated with a single government, but

  <h3  id="the_government&rsquo;s_influence_on_darpa_is_buffered_by_opacity_and_the_director"><span >The government&rsquo;s influence on DARPA is buffered by opacity and the director</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Like almost all government agencies, DARPA answers to the executive branch and receives funding from Congress.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">There are many parts of the US government that are heavily influenced by term-level timescales. For example NASA comes up with a 10 year plan every 8 years for some weird reason. Several DARPA programs operated from
      at least 2012 or 2013 to 2020, which means that they successfully crossed administrative boundaries. However, term-scale incentives may have begun to break down - starting in 2001, DARPA directors began to sync up with presidential
      administrations.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Because </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_program_managers_pull_control_and_risk_away_from_both_researchers_and_directors">DARPA Program managers pull control away from both researchers and directors</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">, the Department of Defense itself
      doesn&rsquo;t have direct control over which programs DARPA is running. However, the Department of Defense does put pressure on the DARPA director to work on areas that are currently relevant to the military, like counter-terrorism and
      insurgent warfare in the 2000&rsquo;s or jungle warfare in the early 1970&rsquo;s.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">An opinionated director is the lynchpin keeping DARPA focused on long-term things that nobody is asking for (yet.) At several points in its history, the director went to bat to keep DARPA from being dissolved or
      absorbed into the military as a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; R&amp;D organization. This secret meta-dependence on the director makes the increasing politicization of the director potentially detrimental to DARPA and there is evidence that DARPA
      has shifted away from long-term disruptive work in conjunction with the probable director politicization.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Originally Congress funded ARPA through a lump sum but over time has shifted to requiring a budget for each program, including what they plan to accomplish for the year</span><sup class=" 1"><a class="internal-link" href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class=" 1">. You know this is bullshit because the plans have statements like </span><span class="quote">&lsquo;Advance development of design tools for the optimization of collaborative problem solving
      performance in human-machine systems and systems-of-systems.&rsquo;</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;In 2003, Congress investigated and effectively defunded the Total Information Awareness Program - an expensive surveillance program riding on the
      heels of September 11th.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Abstractly, opacity seems important because if your source of money is constantly looking over your shoulder and judging what you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re going to take actions that look good. A source of
      money like Congress that has many opinions exacerbates the incentive to &lsquo;play it safe&rsquo; because making sure any action you take is acceptable to a committee is almost as bad as the committee determining those actions. Decisions made
      by committees lead to median results. Coincident with Congress digging more into program specifics, more and more DARPA programs are becoming classified. It is complete speculation but it hints at a tension between DARPA&rsquo;s desire
      to</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#opacity_is_important_to_darpa&rsquo;s_outlier_success">&nbsp;keep things opaque</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;and Congress&rsquo; desire to have oversight thanks to a trust breakdown possibly tied to increasing politicization.</span>
  </p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Over time, DARPA has become less opaque and the director has become more coupled to the current administration. If you buy the argument that it&rsquo;s important to</span><span class="link"><a
        class="internal-link" href="#pay_attention_to_darpa&rsquo;s_informal_process_and_ignore_formal_process">&nbsp;pay attention to DARPA&rsquo;s informal process and ignore formal process</a></span><span >&nbsp;it leads to the conclusion that </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#h.viqjo9z1uop7">opacity
        is important to DARPA&rsquo;s outlier success </a></span><span class="note_to_reader">and DARPAs director is important. </span></p>
  <h3  id="opacity_is_important_to_darpa&rsquo;s_outlier_success"><span >Opacity is important to DARPA&rsquo;s outlier success</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Opacity removes incentives to go for easy wins or to avoid being criticized by external forces. Reporting requirements also add friction around everything from hiring to changing direction to trying crazy things to
      moving quickly and more. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Of course, opacity can also be abused: getting nothing done, dumping money into stupid projects or unnecessary expenses, giving contracts to performers with whom you have a special relationship, or just straight up
      stealing. Opacity can be abused in too many ways to list and prevent, which means that a better strategy is to incentivize people not to abuse it.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="3 1">How does DARPA incentivize people not to abuse the opacity?</span></p>
  <p ><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_is_relatively_tiny_and_flat">DARPA is relatively tiny and flat</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;so it&rsquo;s actually possible for everybody to know everybody. This means that everybody knows what everybody

      either make people want to utterly crush it or not care at all. One way to push for the desire to crush it is simply finding self-motivated people with a lot of integrity who really care about what they&rsquo;re doing. Of course, this strategy
      piles even more weight onto </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_&ldquo;talent&rdquo;_in_other_disciplines">needing awesome program managers</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">. Another way to motivate people to make the best of a temporary assignment is to enable them
      to be as effective as possible. The criticality of effective PMs emphasizes how important it is to minimize even small frictions - process can kill effectiveness through a thousand cuts. This observation suggests that overregulation could
      actually lead to a negative feedback loop of PMs feeling less effective which pushes them to the other end of the behavior spectrum for temporary positions which increases the need for overregulation. Obviously that&rsquo;s an extreme scenario,
      but it emphasizes the need for opacity. In a way it&rsquo;s like a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Nominally venture capitalists are incentivized not to abuse their opacity because of carry. Program managers don&rsquo;t have that incentive.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">So put yourself in the situation of a Program Manager: you can&rsquo;t get promoted, you&rsquo;re out in five years, nobody will know what you&rsquo;ve done whether you succeed or fail, and you&rsquo;re surrounded by
      people who are complete ballers working on amazing things. You can either sit on your butt and do literally nothing, or go all out and try to make something amazing. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any incentive to either hedge bets or make it
      look like you&rsquo;re working when you&rsquo;re not.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">The big question then becomes: </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?">how do you incentivize people to get into that situation in the first place?</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;Bluntly,
      the incentives to do awesome shit once you&rsquo;re part of the organization do not make a compelling sales pitch to join.</span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_does_multiple_levels_of_top-down_problem_generation_and_bottom-up_solution_generation"><span >DARPA does multiple levels of top-down problem generation and bottom-up solution generation</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA completely sidesteps the always-important question &ldquo;is top-down or bottom up better?&rdquo; by doing both.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">In some ways, the program manager is the &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; component. DARPA does an initial pass of top-down when it hires someone. The director or departing PM is usually looking for someone to go after a vague
      area or problem rather than just hiring someone to fill a slot or because they&rsquo;re great and they want to have them on staff. The Program manager then proposes a more explicit solution to the high level problem area and gets it signed off
      by the director. </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">In other ways the program manager is the &lsquo;top down&rsquo; component of top down problems and bottom up solutions. When they are doing initial program design (ie. steps one and two of </span><span

During the actual execution
      phase, while they have a plan and an idea of who they want to deliver on it, they still put out a broad call that anybody can respond to at least nominally keep the door open to other bottom up solutions.</span></p>

  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years. Similarly, before 2001, directors did not stick around much longer. Obviously institutional memory lasts longer than any individual but memory of any
      specific programs dies out quickly because DARPA is relatively tiny and flat so there is only one PM running any program and people pay much more attention to their own work than other people&rsquo;s. This transient memory about failed programs
      means less friction around creating a program that &lsquo;has been tried before&rsquo; and makes it more likely that DARPA can explore &lsquo;unexploited Leonardo Ideas&rsquo; or &lsquo;gems in plain sight&rsquo; - ideas that are good but
      before their time.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#id.ptd3stp98d2l">A former program manager described</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;how there have been multiple instances of program managers starting successful programs that they discovered
      later were almost the same as failed programs from the past. If there were enough people around who had seen the failure, the program manager would have had to not just argue for the validity of their program on its own grounds, but address the
      shadow cast by the failed program. Of course it&rsquo;s rational to try something that failed in the past as long as you explicitly call out why you will succeed when they failed but small amounts of friction can have large effects.
      Essentially, the transient memory about specific ideas allows them to be judged on their own merits instead of dealing with baggage from the past. </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">It&rsquo;s entirely possible that short institutional memory about specific programs could lead to people trying terrible ideas over and over again. You see that with certain forms of government, for example. If
      there are high epistemological standards (enforced by the tech council, informal feedback from other PMs, and the ability to do seedling programs) and there are no externalities to the failure, trying things over and over again has capped
      downsides. Additionally, the institutional memory is short, but not </span><span class="emphasis">that</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;short - you will only get a complete turnover once every ~five years, which is enough time for the constraints in the
      world to change.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">In a way, short institutional memory about programs is like the temporal version of how federated systems like Renaissance Europe prevent disruptive changes completely damped out as opposed to centralized systems
      like Imperial China.</span><a id="footnote_source_8" class="internal-link" href="#footnote_8"><sup class="mark">[8]</sup></a></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_is_relatively_tiny_and_flat"><span >DARPA is relatively tiny and flat</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">As of April 2020, there are 124 staff and three layers. That number is right around Dunbar&rsquo;s Number - just small enough for one person to know everyone in the organization. It&rsquo;s not explicitly designed
      that way but I suspect that it emerged as the right number for the Director to be able to vaguely pay attention to everything that is going on and for everybody in the organization to have vague context on what everybody else is working on.
      There are three layers - the Director, office directors, and program managers (with a few deputy directors thrown in.) Culturally and physically DARPA is set up so everybody can talk and seek advice, so there is lots of ability for idea
      cross-pollination.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA&rsquo;s size may help minimize internal politics. The returns to politics is higher at large organizations because there is less direct accountability and any one person doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of agency to
      change outcomes. Low potential impact makes it more worthwhile to get people to like you than produce results. On the flipside, in DARPA any program and therefore any program manager can potentially create an industry. The small organization
      means that there are no &ldquo;group projects&rdquo; so every PM is directly responsible for the program they&rsquo;re working on and you can&rsquo;t have slackers.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">I suspect the small size also helps keep PM quality high. Quality tends to slip when there is both flexibility in who you can hire and there is pressure to hire a lot of people. Since </span><span class="link"><a
         class="internal-link" href="#darpa_is_incredibly_flexible_with_who_it_hires_to_be_program_managers">the flexibility piece is essential</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">, it becomes important to not have pressure to hire more. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The downside of the tiny flat organization is that there don&rsquo;t seem to be any checks on the Director&rsquo;s power, so if they don&rsquo;t like a program or a person they&rsquo;re out. This is why politicization
      is dangerous. Politicization would lead to the director prioritizing aligning their goals with factors outside of the organization and PMs aligning with the director more than with the organization&rsquo;s nominal goal. </span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_employees_aren&rsquo;t_paid_very_much_compared_to_what_they_could_be"><span >DARPA Employees aren&rsquo;t paid very much compared to what they could be</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">In 2017, a DARPA director is estimated at $76-130k per year and program managers are estimated at $90k. While DARPA does have leeway over salaries compared to the rest of the government, they still can&rsquo;t offer
      the same compensation as large tech companies. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The people with the right qualifications could be making much more. Experienced technical PhDs even outside of software engineering can reasonably expect $170k+. Unfortunately, the things that make &ldquo;great
      talent&rdquo; in high variance industries just boils down to the ability to successfully make things happen under a lot of uncertainty.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">It raises the question - was this more comparable to industry averages in the 60&rsquo;s? From the </span><span ><a

      much smaller.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">There is a positive and a negative argument for low pay. The positive argument is that it weeds out people who are just in it for the money and treat the role as &lsquo;just a job.&rsquo; On the other hand the
      negative argument is that the low pay weeds out people who have some lower bound on what they think they&rsquo;re worth. I can only assume that the widening gap since the 60&rsquo;s has exacerbated this latter point.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">The low pay makes the question &ldquo;</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?">Why do people become DARPA Program managers?</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&rdquo; even more important.</span></p>

  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">If you try to find current and even former DARPA PMs or directors on the internet you&rsquo;ll have a hard time. DARPA avoids hiring people with a significant web presence. In the 21st century, that&rsquo;s remarkable
      and specific enough that it is worth digging into.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Asymmetric career risk happens when you know that the downsides of doing the &rsquo;safe&rsquo; thing are capped while the downsides of doing the &lsquo;risky&rsquo; things are uncapped. Therefore it makes sense that
      you would be more willing to make risky moves in an institutional context if you know you aren&rsquo;t going to be judged on your actions either way after you leave.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">People with a web presence tend to be focused on playing &nbsp;status games or at least are in a world where they realize that their career depends on public perception of their output. Internet people are often
      playing a game to maximize engagement. So being an internet person could be taken as being a signal that a potential PM would have in the back of their mind &ldquo;what will other people think about this?&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">People are more likely to judge a crazy act positively if they know the reasons why it happened. So if the people you care about are a</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#h.uvzndxpjve">&nbsp;small group
        of peers</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;rather than the whole internet it increases incentives to just go for it.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Additionally, less internet presence means less grand announcements and fewer expectations. If you know it&rsquo;s easy to shut something down it&rsquo;s easier to start. Contrast this to something like Peter
      Diamandis and the X-Prize where there is a huge announcement and massive expectations which can quickly lead to institutional distrust when expectations aren&rsquo;t met. My impression is that most people don&rsquo;t take the X-Prize seriously
      anymore because the ratio of smoke to fire keeps increasing.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Of course, it could be more simple and DARPA just doesn&rsquo;t like people who are too loud because they like to keep things hush hush.</span><span class="link"><a
        class="internal-link" href="#opacity_is_important_to_darpa&rsquo;s_outlier_success">&nbsp;Opacity</a></span><span class="link "><a  class="internal-link" href="#opacity_is_important_to_darpa&rsquo;s_outlier_success">&nbsp;is</a></span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#opacity_is_important_to_darpa&rsquo;s_outlier_success">&nbsp;important to DARPA&rsquo;s outlier success</a></span><span

      you&rsquo;re going to do something.</span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_doesn&rsquo;t_do_any_research_in_house"><span >DARPA doesn&rsquo;t do any research in house</span></h3>
  <p ><span class=" 1">There is a ton of literature on </span><span class="emphasis">how </span><span class=" 1">DARPA externalizes research, so I want to dig into s</span><span class="note_to_reader">ome subtle advantages of externalizing
      research:</span></p>
  <ul >
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">It enables DARPA to be relatively tiny and flat.</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">Actual cutting edge research may require rare equipment or knowledge. There are many pieces of equipment or tacit knowledge that only exist in one or two places in the world and it&rsquo;s easier to access them
        through finite projects than purchasing or hiring them.</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">It enables strong accountability because for any program there is exactly one responsible person.</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">It enables program managers to have multiple teams working on the same objective without internal politics.</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">You don&rsquo;t have to lay anyone off or find new work for people when you change direction.</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">You can get people to work on projects who might not want to work for the org full time.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Of course there are also disadvantages:</span></p>
  <ul >
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">There are higher transaction costs in making sure deliverables are created, finding the right people in the first place, paying administrative overhead at the other org, and convincing them to work on projects.
        Coasian tradeoffs everywhere.</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA doesn&rsquo;t have any control over the &ldquo;intellectual exhaust&rdquo; created during projects, which means that they both can&rsquo;t do direct technology dissemination and they do not capture the value
        it creates.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p ><span class=" 1">It&rsquo;s easy to conflate ARPA with Bell Labs, Lockheed </span><span class=" 1">Skunkworks</span><span class="note_to_reader">, or Xerox PARC but they&rsquo;re fundamentally different because R&amp;D orgs lie on a
      spectrum between externalized and internalized and DARPA is all the way on the externalized end, while those other orgs are much closer to the internalized end. A common trap for people claiming to replicate DARPA is internalizing the majority
      of their work. </span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_has_many_tight_feedback_loops"><span >DARPA has many tight feedback loops</span></h3>
  <p ><span class=" 1">From day one there is a feedback loop between a new program manager and the other program managers. &lsquo;Onboarding&rsquo; at DARPA is an informal process that involves mostly oral traditions and shadowing.
      Informal onboarding is normally a no-no when it comes to best practices but most organizations don&rsquo;t limit themselves to</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_is_relatively_tiny_and_flat">&nbsp;Dunbar&rsquo;s number</a></span><span
      >. Program managers get significant informal feedback from other PMs as they hone their program design. This feedback includes whether something is </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#id.usnn8cmycivu">&lsquo;in
        scope&rsquo; for the organization</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;and whether the design is precise enough. High quality informal feedback depends on other PMs actually caring, so this is another reason DARPA PMs need to think for
      themselves, be curious, and have low ego.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">There are multiple levels of feedback loop between the PM and the research community during program design. The tightest loop is informal conversations with individual researchers and groups about where they see
      blockers and possibilities in the area that the PM can then incorporate into their program design. The PM then uses workshops to set up feedback loops between those possibilities - an idea might be good but an enthusiastic proponent could gloss
      over a major hole that needs to be filled. Finally, small projects test the riskiest parts of those possibilities against the world before the PM incorporates them into the program design. &nbsp;The workshops also set up feedback loops between
      previously unconnected groups of researchers focused on the program area that hopefully create new ideas and (ideally) new research communities.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">PMs also set up feedback loops between different parts of an industry - academia, startups, and big companies. Setting up these feedback loops with researchers across </span><span class=" 1">a
      discipline</span><span >&nbsp;is why </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager&rsquo;s_job_is_focused_network_building">a large part of a DARPA program manager&rsquo;s job is </a></span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#a_large_part_of_a_darpa_program_manager&rsquo;s_job_is_focused_network_building">focused

  <p ><span class=" 1">Feedback loops enable a PM to adjust, kill, or start projects as necessary during the execution of the program. Frequent contact with performers working on a project enables both the performer and the PM to
      incorporate new information into decisions on whether they should make small adjustments to the project&rsquo;s goals and how that propagates into the rest of the program. PMs also use this information to decide whether t</span><span
      class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#it_is_relatively_easy_for_darpa_pms_to_re-deploy_funding">o kill the project completely or start a new one</a></span><span >. Failed projects are also part of a feedback loop: </span><span class="quote">The failure (of a performer) triggers a
      discussion in which the first question is whether the goals were correctly specified and how they might be redefined in the light of the research that has already taken place.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The ARPA model also uses long-term feedback loops to maintain high quality PMs and research collaborations. A players hire A players and B players hire C players so high quality program managers make other high
      quality program managers want to join. Low friction interactions with DARPA and funding that enables performers to do things they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do otherwise keeps ideas coming from the community.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Even PM hiring is part of a feedback loop between the organization and the outside world. PMs are hired to explore a specific area that DARPA wants to explore. Even though it works on technology that nobody knows
      they need yet, DARPA needs to be responsive to changes in the world - whether it&rsquo;s new possibilities (technology push) or new needs (technology pull.) &nbsp;This buffering between the outside world and hiring is one of the ways DARPAs
      director is important.</span></p>

  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">A lot of DARPA&rsquo;s budget is spent on actually assembling weapons and vehicle systems. So the math works out that only ~$400m is actually being spent on &lsquo;basic research.&rsquo;</span></p>

  <ol  ="1">
    <li class=" 2"><span class="note_to_reader">Is it essential that a research org is a small fraction of the money factory&rsquo;s budget? That is, can an outlier producing organization only exist as a small attachment to a bigger organization? You see

  <p ><span class="note_to_reader"></span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Why is DARPA more ideas limited than money limited?</span></p>
  <ul >
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">At any time there are only so many ideas in the world that fall into the sweet spot of just hitting an inflection point on an s-curve - having enough potential that a concerted effort will get them to a take
        off trajectory but not so obvious that everyone is piling resources into it.</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">Almost by definition, the more of a Big H hard problem it is &nbsp;(ie. one that needs a breakthrough instead of just more engineering effort) the less throwing money at it will help. </span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">Unlike startups, DARPA is not in the business of dispersion. When you have something that scales, by definition more money = more results. </span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">Something about the idea marketplace for ideas - once people realize that something is a good idea, DARPA money is less useful. </span></li>
  </ul>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader"></span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">VC firms experience a similar effect - they tend to have lower percent returns as funds get bigger even though they *are* in the business of scaling things. </span></p>

  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Modern program managers need to get approval from their director to write larger grants and they need to work through official government vehicles like open grant calls and government websites. &#x1f62d; However, the
      PM is the only person reading the grant proposals and they don&rsquo;t need to check with anybody before deploying the money once it&rsquo;s been allocated. This process is still fast compared to other funding agencies like the NSF where there
      is literally a committee that deliberates over grant applications. Even large companies or universities require you to submit a request before spending a large chunk of money.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">In the past there was almost no oversight over PM spending after the director authorized the money. This is how J.C.R. Licklider was able to &ldquo;Johnny Appleseed&rdquo; computing groups all over the country in only
      a year. The transition from ARPA to DARPA was coupled to more oversight on military spending, which inevitably introduced more overhead.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">The ability to deploy money without much overhead is important for many reasons including making it worthwhile to write smaller checks, opening the door to more collaborators, and just plain moving fast. If it is
      an equal amount of pain for the PM to write a check regardless of size and the same amount of pain for a performer to apply for any amount of money, there will be some threshold below which the money is not worth the effort. Small amounts of
      friction can have large effects! High overhead means only larger projects will happen. Larger projects take more time and are more serious, so if all projects were large it would kill two critical pieces for getting to breakthroughs:
    </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_has_many_tight_feedback_loops">feedback loops</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;and play. High-overhead, formal grant applications weed out many potentially useful collaborations such as people who don&rsquo;t
      understand how the grant process works or who are terrible at writing grants (both of which are unrelated to their ability to do good work.) </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">The ability to move quickly is important because often the money is going towards keeping the lights on or a grad student in the lab, so if an organization can&rsquo;t get the money quickly they are going to work
      on a different project and become unavailable even if the money is available later. Fast money allows a PM </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#it_is_relatively_easy_for_darpa_pms_to_re-deploy_funding">to quickly act on new information and adjust the trajectory of the
        program</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;which can make it more likely to succeed. There is also something intangible about the feeling of &lsquo;momentum&rsquo; that you can&rsquo;t get if you have to constantly go over road bumps.</span>
  </p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Of course, the ability to deploy money quickly requires high trust in both the PM&rsquo;s integrity and their judgement. Restrictions on spending money happen when you reach trust limits. Overhead exists for a
      rational reason - money can be embezzled and people always spend money for a purpose so whoever is providing the money wants to know that it is being well-spent. Yet another reason why it circles back to &ldquo;</span><span class="link"><a

  <p ><span class=" 1">DARPA PMs have the ability to pull funding built into contracts with performers, which means that they can quickly move money away from an approach that isn&rsquo;t working and into an approach that is working.
      You would expect people to be hesitant to work on something risky if they know that the funding could be pulled quickly. </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#id.8m3f38cq2od6">Anna Goldstein</a></span><span >&nbsp;pointed
      out that the actual pieces of the programs are less risky, because within a project the goals can shift. </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_program_managers_pull_control_and_risk_away_from_both_researchers_and_directors">Instead the PMs take on the risk of the entire program failing.</a></span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">It&rsquo;s not clear whether easy fund-pulling was always part of DARPA or if it was introduced as part of formal process around deliverables. However, it seems worth considering part of the ARPA model and replicating
      for two reasons.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">First, it makes sense that easily re-deployed funds would increase willingness for funding </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_funds_wacky_things_that_go_nowhere">wacky things that might go nowhere</a></span><span
      class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;because if you know it&rsquo;s easy to shut something down it&rsquo;s easier to start.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Second, it increases the contrast between DARPA and other institutions that give out money like pure grant-giving orgs and venture capital. Organizations that give out long-term grants like the National Science
      Foundation or Howard Hughes Medical Institute need to either very carefully consider proposals which </span><span >leads</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;to death by committee or lean on trust in a researcher&rsquo;s experience.
      Either way, it slices out a large amount of idea-space. Venture capitalists write checks that are meant to fund a company for 18 months or more. This timescale means that they can end up with a lot of sunk cost in a company that is clearly not
      doing well. That possibility rationally leads to more risk aversion and when it inevitably happens it can burn time and resources trying to help the struggling company.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Mechanically, DARPA sets up easily-redeployed funding by using contracts instead of grants for most research and having goals in the contracts that are almost impossible to hit. If the performer doesn&rsquo;t hit the
      goal, it is at the PMs discretion whether to cancel the contract. </span></p>

      &nbsp;Tactically, PMs get to this point by first talking to researchers in a domain about what they&rsquo;re working on and start to synthesize possibilities into a vision of where the domain could go. They also get small groups of researchers
      together to hone ideas against each other and figure out where the key constraints lie. Massive constraints imposed by the laws of physics can kill the program right there, but if there is uncertainty that can be </span><span class="link"><a

Tactically, PMs get to this point by bringing together small groups of researchers to map out precisely what the pieces of the puzzle
      look like, which are the most risky, and where the unknowns are, what experiments could be done to resolve the biggest risks. They figure out where you can&rsquo;t get more precision without experiment and do those experiments as part of
      seedling programs. The PM &nbsp;lays out where the biggest blockers are along the roadmap and figure out the different approaches that you could take to remove the same blockers. </span></p>
  <h4  id="3._make_thing_possible"><span >3. Make thing possible</span></h4>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">This is where the PM spends the majority of the time and money in the program and can potentially last through the tenure of multiple program managers. During this step PMs fund different groups to work on different
      pieces and approaches for the problem. The PM makes sure that the groups working on different pieces are communicating through both formal and informal channels to minimize getting stuck and maximize new ideas. The PMs adjust frequently,
      killing approaches that aren&rsquo;t working and reroute funds to new approaches that come up.</span></p>
  <h3  id="the_initial_exploratory_tranche_of_a_darpa_program_is_approximately_$1.5m"><span >The initial exploratory tranche of a DARPA program is approximately $1.5m</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Most of this money goes towards small &lsquo;seedling programs.&rsquo; These seedling programs are small grants or contracts designed to help solidify that an idea is both not impossible and that it is in fact
      possible within scope. Intriguingly, this is in the same ballpark as a large seed round for a startup or the amount of money you need to set up a lab.</span></p>

  <p ><span class=" 1">According to PMs I&rsquo;ve grilled on this question, the closest thing to a framework that PMs use to guide program design is &ldquo;be able to explain precisely why this idea will work to a group of really smart
      experts both in the area of the program and adjacent to it.&rdquo; In short, PMs design a program against a mental model of the </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#every_program_at_darpa_is_intensely_technically_scrutinized_by_the_tech_council">Tech Council. &nbsp;</a></span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The amount of risk the council is willing to give a thumbs-up on depends heavily on the office and its role. The Defense Science Office is much more risk tolerant than the Tactical Technology Office for example.
      &nbsp;The Tactical Technology Office actually builds prototypes and passes them off to the military, while the Defense Science Office works on more speculative projects. </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">PMs get </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_has_many_tight_feedback_loops">informal feedback</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;throughout the program design process on whether the program is likely to be approved by the
      council. It&rsquo;s key that this feedback is from people who are good models of the council as opposed to schmucks with an opinion, which is the case with advice in many other disciplines. I suspect this zero-consequence but tight feedback
      loop during the design process is important.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">While the framework doesn&rsquo;t have much structure, it does give PMs a very fixed end goal - answering </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#id.z3zi0hfoi0ff">The Heilmeier Catechism</a></span><span

  <h3  id="every_program_at_darpa_is_intensely_technically_scrutinized_by_the_tech_council"><span >Every program at DARPA is intensely technically scrutinized by the tech council</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The `Tech Council` is composed of people with technical expertise in the proposed program&rsquo;s area and adjacent areas. The Tech Council Pitch Meeting is meant to be very high level but council members can ask deep
      technical questions on anything. &nbsp;The tech council doesn&rsquo;t have any power besides advising the director on the program&rsquo;s technical soundness. A purely advisory tech council seems like a good idea because it both avoids decision
      by committee and keeps all responsibility squarely on the director and PM.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">PMs should have &lsquo;</span><span class=" 1">derisked</span><span class=" 1">&rsquo; the idea before going into the meeting by using seedling programs, workshops, and precise roadmapping. &nbsp;The way
      the tech council meeting was described to me is that it&rsquo;s roughly like a university seminar in a room full of people who you </span><span class="emphasis">cannot</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;bullshit and who have enough technical experience to
      dig into anything about the program. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s important that the meeting be egoless and clearly focused on making the program as good as possible because this sort of thing can easily go down a rabbit hole if people feel the need to
      show how smart they are or just destroy the presenter. The need for the tech council to &lsquo;get it&rsquo; suggests that it should be composed of other PMs.</span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_pms_use_seedling_projects_to_&lsquo;acid_test&rsquo;_the_riskiest_pieces_of_a_program_idea"><span >DARPA PMs use seedling projects to &lsquo;acid test&rsquo; the riskiest pieces of a program idea</span></h3>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Seedlings are 3-9 month projects that cost &nbsp;$0.05M -&gt; $1M and are designed to </span><span class="quote">`Move concepts from &ldquo;disbelief &rdquo; to &ldquo;mere doubt&quot;`</span><span class="note_to_reader">. This
      means that in an initial exploratory tranche that costs approximately $1.5m, you expect to run roughly a dozen seedlings.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">There is little oversight on the money spent on seedling programs as long as the budget is less than ~$500k. PMs don&rsquo;t need to get the money pre-approved and unlike larger and later projects, DARPA PMs
      don&rsquo;t have to use open solicitations for seedlings. In essence the PM can go to whoever they want and say &ldquo;I need this done.&rdquo; Zero oversight enables them to move extremely fast. Restrictions on spending money happen when you
      reach trust limits, so this low-oversight spending is another reason why DARPA depends on high trust in badass PMs.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Seedlings are not about finding a solution to a problem, they&rsquo;re designed to verify or disprove a hypothesis. The idea for seedlings can either come from the Program Manager or from a performer. Either way
      the ideas are part of a </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_has_many_tight_feedback_loops">feedback loop between the PM and the research community</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;during program design.</span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_facilitates_cross-polination_both_between_pms_and_performers"><span>DARPA facilitates cross-polination both between PMs and Performers</span></h3>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Everybody at DARPA has deep experience in some technical area and there is a culture of people dropping by and asking each other about the subject of their expertise. The way a former PM described this atmosphere
      was weirdly similar to the one attributed to Bell Labs at its peak. The culture also encourages PMs to discuss their programs with other PMs. This cultural artifact is special because it would be easy for everybody to mind their own business as
      everybody is working on their own programs. It would also be easy for PMs to feel competitive. DARPA&rsquo;s small size probably helps walk this fine line between PMs not caring about what other people are working on and caring </span><span
      class="emphasis">too much.</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve read some accounts that disagree with this description of DARPA culture, instead portraying a situation with little interactions between PMs. I attribute the discrepancy to the
      culture being different either in different offices or at different times because I put higher weight on the description I heard directly from talking to former PMs.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Performers who get DARPA funding are required to share research with each other at various closed-door workshops. Since they are all presumably working on different aspects of the same problem, this seems
      valuable. The sharing has some of the aspects of </span><span class="link"><a  href="https://osf.io/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591636119726000">open science</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;but among a much more
      focused group of people. Ideally, the closed-door workshops bring together the people who might benefit from the knowledge and keep out the tourists and hangers on that can destroy nascent communities. The forced early sharing stands in
      contrast to normal academia where everything is a first-to-the-post system that incentivizes people to pipet out information to their peers because they are (rationally) worried about getting scooped. </span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_provides_a_derisking_role_for_people_in_other_organizations"><span >DARPA provides a derisking role for people in other organizations</span></h2>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA derisks working on breakthrough ideas for three big groups: researchers, companies, and other funders.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">DARPA obviously derisks whether researchers will be able to get funding to work on an idea. Researchers don&rsquo;t have as much uncertainty around grant proposals because </span><span class="link"><a
        class="internal-link" href="#program_managers_have_the_ability_to_deploy_money_without_much_overhead">program managers have the ability to deploy money without much overhead</a></span><span >.</span><span >&nbsp;Instead of the common situation where a funder says &ldquo;that sounds great! But
      I need to check with my boss/our budget doesn&rsquo;t allow it,&rdquo; if a PM says &ldquo;that sounds great&rdquo; it probably means that you&rsquo;ll get funding. The ability to plan is a big deal. PMs also derisk working off the beaten path
      for researchers more subtly by building a community around a technological vision. The community is secretly critical because the peer review and citation system incentivizes people to work on things that other people think is interesting. So
      even if an academic could get funding to work on crazy shit, most people wouldn&rsquo;t work on it because they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get the results published and cited. By </span><span class="link"><a

  <p ><span class=" 1">DARPA derisks working off the beaten path for small companies by giving them more confidence that there will be customers for their product - either large companies or the government. In the best case, the promise
      of future procurement functions like a prize to incentivize startups to spend their own money on top of the money from DARPA. Startups building &lsquo;frontier tech&rsquo; often falter at the stage where they need to scale up production.
    </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_&ldquo;talent&rdquo;_in_other_disciplines">By encouraging small companies to work with large companies earlier in the process, DARPA PMs reduce scale-up risk as well</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">. In this way DARPA PMs act in a
      similar way to biotech VCs, brokering relationships between small companies with specialized skills and large companies with production capacity. Additionally, other customers often see DARPA funding as third-party validation of a
      startup&rsquo;s technology. The DARPA validation can be critical for breaking the chicken-and-egg that nobody will buy your product until someone has bought your product.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">From a founder: </span><span class="quote">&quot;DARPA funding has the added benefit of communicating to a third party a validation of the technology.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">For large companies, the off-the-balance sheet work to show that an idea is feasible and clear evidence of demand derisks the idea to the point that they&rsquo;re willing to start spending their own R&amp;D dollars on
      it. Companies want R&amp;D to be off of their balance sheets as much as possible. For example, DARPA worked with IBM and Intel to develop nanophotonics and afterward the companies took them on as R&amp;D programs.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="quote">&ldquo;So the DARPA piece, while large, was the validation for IBM to spend their own money.&rdquo; He continues, &ldquo;The same way for the Intel piece. You know, Intel certainly looked at that project, and then
      Intel ended up funding it internally, but the fact that DARPA went back to them three and four times and said, this is an important thing, this is an important thing, you know, it got to the board of directors, and it got high enough that they
      set up a division to do this.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Most grant-giving organizations </span><span class=" 1">try to </span><span class=" 1">derisk</span><span class=" 1">&nbsp;them as much as possible</span><sup class=" 1"><a class="internal-link" href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class=" 1">.

      follow-on funding from more risk-averse grant-giving organizations. </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">From a professor: </span><span class="quote">&quot;Once you&rsquo;ve gotten funding from DARPA, you have an issue resolved, and so on, then you go right ahead and submit an NSF proposal. By which time your ideas are
      known out there, people know you, you&rsquo;ve published a paper or two. And then guys at NSF say, yeah, yeah, this is a good thing.&rdquo; He continues, distinguishing DARPA&rsquo;s place within the broader U.S. government system, &ldquo;NSF
      funding usually comes in a second wave. DARPA provides initial funding.&rdquo; As a consequence, he concludes, &ldquo;DARPA plays a huge role in selecting key ideas&rdquo; (from among the broader set of ideas present in the research
      community).</span></p>
  <h2  id="room_for_improvement"><span >Room for Improvement</span></h2>
  <p ><span class=" 1 ">DARPA analyses can end up looking like hagiographies - this document is no exception. Clearly DARPA has downsides. Instead of caveating every conclusion, it seems productive to group problems thematically and
      use those groupings to suggest places where an organization using the ARPA model may be able to improve on the original. </span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa&rsquo;s_primary_purpose_is_to_develop_military_technology"><span >DARPA&rsquo;s primary purpose is to develop military technology</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The D in DARPA stands for &ldquo;Defense&rdquo; - ultimately DARPA&rsquo;s explicit purpose is to support the DoD. Even before the addition of &ldquo;D&rdquo; ARPA was mission-oriented around the military. at the same
      time as J.C.R. Licklider was sowing the seeds of personal computing and the internet, William Godel was managing ARPA programs to build silent planes and boats, agent orange, and AR-15 rifles. Even J.C.R. Licklider&rsquo;s computer work was
      started in response to an incident where the US almost started a nuclear exchange because a computer couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between the Moon and a fleet of incoming bombers combined with JFK&rsquo;s desire to have a better
      command-and-control overview of the US military. For the most part, the non-military technology that came out of DARPA was a happy byproduct.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">While we can abstract the ARPA model away from DARPA&rsquo;s military focus, it is important to keep that focus in mind because in the long run incentives win and at the end of the day, innovation organizations that
      are misaligned with their funding source are either neutered or destroyed. Aspects of the parent organization leaks into any innovation organization&rsquo;s focus regardless of any commitment to paradigm-shifting long-term work.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The military milieu of the day has always driven DARPA&rsquo;s focus: Vietnam, the Cold War, concerns about offshoring eliminating US ability to build its own military technology, and terrorism. DARPA is the source of
      many technologies that the show Black Mirror has used to paint dystopian futures - killer drones, surveillance AI, walking robots, and more.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">You can see this focus leak in ARPA-E, the Department of Energy (DOE)&rsquo;s ARPA riff. The DOE doesn&rsquo;t really have one straightforward mission - it used to be &ldquo;ensure nuclear superiority&rdquo;
      (historical sidenote - all the DOE national labs were originally established to optimize and advance different parts of the nuclear weapons process.) ARPA-E is similarly a bit confused - is it trying to lower the cost of energy? Shift us to
      renewables faster? Help the energy industry or upend it?</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Two upshots. First, DARPA&rsquo;s military focus means that there are ideas that are </span><span class="emphasis">out of scope.</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;A former PM explicitly confirmed that while DARPA is ideas
      limited, there are ideas well-suited for the ARPA model that DARPA doesn&rsquo;t pursue. Second, the source of authority and funding matters for anybody attempting to riff on the ARPA model.</span></p>
  <h3  id="the_arpa_model_is_high-variance"><span >The ARPA Model is high-variance</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The same mechanisms that enable an organization to move quickly and work on weird, paradigm-shifting programs can also enable massive waste and fraud. The parallel stories of J.C.R. Licklider and William Godel
      illustrate both edges of the sword. Both men were ARPA program managers in the 60&rsquo;s. Both had precise, grand visions of technology that could change the world. Both had unmonitored access to funds once the DARPA director gave the ok. But
      while &nbsp;Licklider helped midwife modern computing and computer science as a field, Godel helped unleash ineffective chemical atrocity on Vietnam, laid the groundwork for the security state, and was arrested by the FBI and convicted for
      embezzlement.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The experience of working with ARPA is also high variance. Both first and second-hand experience confirms that sometimes DARPA is an amazing partner and sometimes it is hair-tearingly frustrating. Sometimes you come
      in expecting someone like Licklider and you get something closer to a standard government bureaucracy. Perhaps here is a place where you could actually improve on the model with the modern &lsquo;innovation&rsquo; of customer obsession - high
      quality programs depend on continued relationships with high quality performers, so being a pleasure to work with should be paramount.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Uncomfortably, the ARPA model&rsquo;s high variance is a case where you can&rsquo;t cut off just one tail of a distribution. Any guard rails would slow down the process or constrain PMs, reducing both possible
      downsides and potential massive upsides. It is unsatisfying but the only solution that doesn&rsquo;t kill the goose that lays the golden eggs is &ldquo;culture and good people.&rdquo; Acknowledging this fact directly enables everybody in an
      organization riffing on the ARPA model to look the potential downsides straight in the eye. &ldquo;With great power comes great responsibility&rdquo; is a great adage for program managers.</span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_falls_into_many_classic_government_organization_traps"><span >DARPA falls into many classic government organization traps</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA doesn&rsquo;t always stick to the &lsquo;ideal&rsquo; APRA framework that others and I normally describe. DARPA programs can also look much more like a normal government R&amp;D program - the military needs
      something, so they tell the director to start a program around the idea. The director finds a program manager to execute on the idea. The program manager ends up looking much more like a project manager with very little input over the direction
      of the program at all. This way of doing things seems relatively rare and happens more in the military-systems prototype focused offices (TTO and DSO) than elsewhere</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">While DARPA has been granted some exceptions to broad government rules around hiring and how they can spend money, DARPA is still subject to many &lsquo;stupid government rules.&rsquo; They aren&rsquo;t allowed to
      use Google Docs or Zoom regardless of how un-sensitive information is. Modern DARPA still requires grants to go through the official government grant application website. The </span><span ><a
        href="https://beta.sam.gov/opp/059d8cd9eda40b8ae04ed843732d0b6e/view%23general&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591636119730000">grant application page</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;is almost tear-inducing. Cold contacting a
      PM requires filling out a web form that then sends a note to the PM&rsquo;s secretary who may or may not set up a time for you to talk to the PM a month out. I can only imagine this friction reduces the number of serendipitous ideas PM&rsquo;s
      receive. The IARPA, the National Intelligence Agency&rsquo;s ARPA organization, puts emails directly on the website so &lsquo;it&rsquo;s to prevent too many emails&rsquo; is not a valid excuse. From personal experience, at least some DARPA
      employees treat the weekend as sacred no-work-email time regardless of urgency - a behavior I associate with large bureaucracies where people have little stake in outcomes.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">And at the end of the day politics still sneaks in. The biggest example of this were the changes in 1972 thanks to shifting views on the military as a consequence of Vietnam. Throughout DARPA&rsquo;s history, new
      presidents have occasionally replaced the DARPA director and starting in 2001, DARPA directors began to sync up with presidential administrations, which suggests increasing politics over time.</span></p>
  <h3  id="the_arpa_model_can_lead_to_inbreeding"><span >The ARPA model can lead to inbreeding</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The path of least resistance when you&rsquo;re hiring is to hire people you know, and people tend to know people like themselves. This human tendency, combined with hiring flexibility means that DARPA tends to bring
      people on as program managers who are already in the DAPRA sphere - researchers who work on government projects, military personnel, and generally &ldquo;Washington DC people.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">One consequence of insularity is that, from personal experience</span><sup class=" 1"><a class="internal-link" href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="note_to_reader">, there is a significant cultural gap between DARPA and
      Silicon Valley. This gap includes legal organizational structures, the expectations of funders, the importance of storytelling, communication style, and more. Since venture capital and startups are an increasingly important technology
      dispersion mechanism, the culture gap impairs DARPA&rsquo;s ability to effectively transfer technology. To be explicit: my point isn&rsquo;t to criticize DARPA for not having more of a &lsquo;startup culture&rsquo;, but to illustrate that
      cultural insularity can impede technology dispersion.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Cultural inbreeding can also impede DARPA&rsquo;s ability to work with the best possible performers. While ideally program managers can cast a dragnet that puts their program on the radar of everybody who might be
      able to contribute, in reality many people who might be able to contribute are totally unaware. The announcements are still mostly picked up by people in the DARPA &ldquo;sphere.&rdquo; I have personal experience with this gap - I was working
      on technology for manipulating an uncooperative satellite at literally the same time that DARPA was running a program to capture and repurpose satellites and didn&rsquo;t hear about it until after the grant calls had closed.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">There is also a fine line between &lsquo;working with people you trust for the sake of expediency&rsquo; and &lsquo;giving money to your buddies even if they aren&rsquo;t the best ones for the job.&rsquo; Although PMs
      have definitely gone over this line - the Total Information Awareness program poured money into a consulting firm run by the PMs former colleagues - DARPA has managed to remain shockingly scandal free.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">A riff on the ARPA model could possibly address the potential inbreeding problem explicitly putting in effort to seek out weirdos and people from &lsquo;different worlds.&rsquo;</span></p>
  <h3  id="darpa_has_a_mixed_record_on_transitioning"><span >DARPA has a mixed record on transitioning</span></h3>
  <p ><span class=" 1">The </span><span class=" 1">ARPA model has the explicit intention that technologies get out of the lab and into the real world. Clearly DARPA has successfully transitioned paradigm-changing technology to the
      government, large companies, and startups, so the model&rsquo;s design isn&rsquo;t worthless. However, many DARPA technologies still fall into &lsquo;The Valley of Death&rsquo;</span><a id="footnote_source_11" class="internal-link" href="#footnote_11"><sup class="mark">[11]</sup></a><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;and even successful transitions often are not smooth.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA&rsquo;s history pockmarked with stories that go &ldquo;and then at the end of the program, the military or industry said &lsquo;that&rsquo;s cool, but we like the way we do it now.&rsquo;&rdquo; Or perhaps
      worse, they say &lsquo;that looks great&rsquo; and take ownership of the technology but then completely stop working on scaling it up. In some of these cases the outside organizations come around: DARPA funded the development of UAVs in the
      80&rsquo;s, the Navy took on and then killed the program, DARPA continued development until the military paradigm shifted in the 90&rsquo;s. The story is similar for optoelectronics. While counterfactuals are hard, these common &lsquo;near
      death&rsquo; stories suggest that there are many programs that vaporized on impact with existing paradigms.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Each transition failure, like unhappy families, is unique. Some of the failure modes do rhyme:</span></p>
  <ul >
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">The technology is great, but it both doesn&rsquo;t slot well into a product line at a big company and investors can&rsquo;t see how it could lead to a massively valued company in less than a decade.</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">The people who worked on the technology are great researchers but terrible entrepreneurs. The skills that make you good at seeking+executing on government projects can be quite disjoint from the skills that make
        you good at building and selling a product.</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">The pieces of the program don&rsquo;t come together in one place. Each project in a program is a piece of a puzzle and most of the time they&rsquo;re far more valuable together than on their own - a mouse
        isn&rsquo;t much use without a GUI. For maximum impact, those pieces eventually need a single home after the program ends. Personal computing was such a success story in part because as ARPA took its foot off of the gas pedal, Richard Taylor
        was able to bring the pieces in-house at PARC. Speculatively, bringing the pieces together may have become harder because the Bayh-Dole act enabled universities to extract licensing fees on research they created with government money,
        potentially bleeding dry anybody who wants to license from multiple universities who each want their cut. </span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA often works on ideas that nobody thinks they want. A program can fail to address the core reason why there&rsquo;s no demand. In a way, DARPA programs are like cave dives - you want to get somewhere that
        requires you to decouple from safety/the market but you need to get somewhere with oxygen/demand in a finite amount of time. You can miscalculate where you need to end up or the target can move.</span></li>
    <li ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA works on programs that go against the established paradigm. Changing paradigms might endanger someone&rsquo;s job or just be more work than any advocate is willing to do.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Many of these failure modes illustrate the tension between &lsquo;building something people want&rsquo; and &lsquo;building something capable of shifting paradigms.&rsquo;</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Transitions are an area where an organization riffing on the ARPA model may be able to make big improvements over DARPA. It is important to first acknowledge that DARPA doesn&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum. The
      mechanisms for technology dispersion at its disposal are subject to the constraints of the world around it. In the 1970&rsquo;s that meant large corporations like Xerox, defense contractors, or government labs. The constraints on those
      organizations have shifted, and VC-backed startups have become an important mechanism as well. DARPA has worked to adjust to this new environment - going so far as to create a commercialization team in 2017. But from personal experience the
      adjustment has been clunky. I don&rsquo;t have a great answer yet, but it&rsquo;s important to ask &ldquo;what would an organization built from the ground up with transitions into today (or tomorrow&rsquo;s) environment in mind look
      like?&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader"></span></p>
  <h2  id="riffing_on_the_arpa_model"><span >Riffing on the ARPA Model</span></h2>
  <p ><span class=" 1">When talking about riffs on the ARPA model, it&rsquo;s important to distinguish between organizations that spiritually riff on the ARPA model and structurally riff on it. Spiritual riffs (or just spiritual rhymes)
      are organizations that have enabled or strived to enable high-risk, possibly paradigm changing, goal-focused research. People often conflate DARPA with great R&amp;D organizations of the past - Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, Lockheed Skunkworks, and
      others. It doesn&rsquo;t help that DARPA funded and helped organize research at all of these places. While I am all for being spiritually inspired by DARPA, we&rsquo;re digging into the hypothesis that DARPA&rsquo;s </span><span
      class="emphasis">structure</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;is worth riffing on, so I&rsquo;m going to ignore organizations that fall into this category.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">To my knowledge, there haven&rsquo;t been any attempts to structurally riff on DARPA before the latter half of the 00&rsquo;s. This timing is intriguing in itself, and a pure speculation is that it is the consequence
      of a dawning realization that something wasn&rsquo;t working in the research pipeline. But that is another story for another time. Evaluating these ARPA rifflings as successes or failures is difficult, given that they are all younger than 13
      years old, ARPA style programs usually take five or more years to produce a result (and often much longer to have an impact), and the expected success rate is 5-10 programs out of every 100. I will touch on whether they &lsquo;feel&rsquo;
      success-y, but primarily we should focus on the deviations they have made from the standard ARPA model, whether they make sense in context, and whether we would expect the deltas to lead to more success or failure over time. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">There are surprisingly few attempts to riff on the ARPA model. The US government has built two DARPA imitators: IARPA and ARPA-E. The British government has floated building an ARPA. In the private sector, Google ATAP
      is DARPA-esque enough to talk about and Wellcome Leap appears to be a full-on health-focused implementation of the ARPA model.</span></p>
  <h3  id="iarpa:_intelligence_arpa"><span >IARPA: Intelligence ARPA</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">I(ntelligence)ARPA started operation in 2007 and is run by the Department of National Intelligence. It currently has 17 program managers as of 2020, which makes it roughly the size of one of DARPA&rsquo;s six offices.
      At first glance, it has all the pieces of the ARPA model: empowered program managers coordinating high-risk high-reward external research.</span></p>
  <h4  id="differences_from_darpa"><span >Differences from DARPA</span></h4>
  <p ><span class=" 1">IARPA explicitly does </span><span class="emphasis">zero</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;commercialization - all technology transfers are to intelligence agencies. This stands in contrast to DARPA which transfers to large
      companies and the VC/Startup Ecosystem as well as DoD agencies.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">IARPA spends around a quarter of its budget on testing and validation of the technology that comes out of its programs. Given IARPA&rsquo;s focus on computer security and computation in general, this spending both
      makes sense and is intriguing. What would a focus on testing and validation look like for other technologies? One failure mode for technology trying to leave the lab is extreme fragility (only working in ideal situations, etc.) and a validation
      mechanism might cost more in the short term but lead to more robust technology in the long term.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">IARPA uses contests and tournaments as a first-class tool for generating research. DARPA has run a few tournaments which arguably were significant successes - the grand challenge and the urban challenge catalyzed a
      phase change in autonomous driving from a research novelty to a potential industry. The DARPA robotics challenge was disappointing, but &#8532; is great for high-risk programs. Despite the outlier results, DARPA tournaments are the exception,
      not the rule. The reasons for this difference aren&rsquo;t clear - it may be that computing-based tournaments are easier to coordinate and standardize or it simply comes down to a matter of culture. Several economists have pointed out that
      prizes are underused as a research funding mechanism and when I&rsquo;ve directly asked DARPA PMs why they don&rsquo;t use prize mechanisms more often the answer was &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; IARPA&rsquo;s regular use of tournaments,
      DARPA&rsquo;s infrequent but high impact tournaments, and missing evidence to the contrary suggests that prizes may be a useful place for an organization riffing on the ARPA model to explore.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Surprisingly IARPA is much </span><span class="emphasis">less</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;sensitive about its research than DARPA. Most of IARPAs programs are unclassified, in contrast to ~1/3 of DARPA programs that
      are classified. IARPA also funds organizations outside the US. It seems useful to &nbsp;tap into as many resources as possible so my hunch is that this is a useful change.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">IARPA has a policy of making sure there is a potential intelligence agency &lsquo;customer&rsquo; before undertaking a program. While this seems well-intentioned, it means that IARPA will never be able to change a
      paradigm unless an intelligence agency already feels like it should be changed.</span></p>
  <h5  id="iarpa&rsquo;s_results"><span class="    ">IARPA&rsquo;s Results</span></h5>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">IARPA has 37 ongoing programs and 26 completed programs as of mid 2020. At a 10% success rate, there&rsquo;s a 95% chance that at least one of them would have succeeded. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">IARPA funded a significant chunk of quantum computing research in the US in the 2007-2010 period, including David Wineland&rsquo;s research that went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics in 2012. It&rsquo;s not
      completely roses though - IARPA cut off funding to NIST researchers, including Wineland, because they didn&rsquo;t want to fund other government organizations. It&rsquo;s not clear if they resumed that funding or are claiming credit for the
      Nobel prize research that they funded and then cut off &hellip;</span></p>
  <p ><span class="quote">As of 2009, IARPA was said to provide a large portion of quantum computing funding resources in the United States.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Has IARPA started any industries yet? No, but if quantum computing becomes as big a deal as people think it could be, I suspect IARPA will play a large role in the stories about it.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="emphasis">Not serious note</span><span class=" 1">. Look </span><span class="note_to_reader">at this list of IARPA program names and rejoice ye LoTR and Mythology nerds: Ithildin, MAEGLIN, SIMARILS, Amon-Hen, Odin, ATHENA, ICArUS,
      Mercury.</span></p>
  <h3  id="arpa-e:_arpa-energy"><span >ARPA-E: ARPA-Energy</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">ARPA-E(nergy) started operation in 2009 and is run by the Department of Energy. It currently has 20 program managers and a budget of ~$180M as of 2020. That makes it approximately the size of one DARPA office. Like
      IARPA, it has all the pieces of the ARPA model on paper: empowered program managers coordinating high-risk high-reward external research.</span></p>
  <h4  id="differences_from_darpa"><span >Differences from DARPA</span></h4>
  <p ><span class=" 1">ARPA-E is on the opposite end of the transfer spectrum from IARPA: while IARPA </span><span class="emphasis">only</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;hands off technology to its funding departments, ARPA-E primarily targets
      private companies to adopt and scale up its program&rsquo;s output (DARPA does both.) Transfer via commercialization makes sense given that the Department of Energy doesn&rsquo;t actually build or deploy energy technology. ARPA-E adapted the
      ARPA model to target commercialization in several ways: it has a whole commercialization team; on-staff lawyers; and explicitly considers how the technology is going to be implemented by the energy industry before embarking on a program. While
      these adaptations are logical, they may be shooting the ARPA model in the foot. The additional apparatus around commercialization makes ARPA-E less flat than DARPA - there are more non-PM staff than PMs, which cuts into the benefits of DARPA
      being tiny and flat.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">While DARPA is funded by congress as part of the DOE budget, the DOE funds ARPA-E programs directly. Direct program funding means that the DOE has much more say over which programs ARPA-E runs and how they spend
      money. This subtle difference in funding sources make ARPA-E less independent from the DOE and may invalidate the buffer between the government political machine and DARPA provided by opacity and its director. Since ARPA-E is targeting transfer
      to non-DOE entities, the increased DOE oversight may lead to one of those lovely situations where an entity with no skin-in-the-game has a large say on risky activities.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">ARPA-E is explicitly metrics-driven. While this approach certainly jives with modern sensibilities, my hunch is that metrics can hamstring embryonic technology. Metrics are great when you know what you&rsquo;re
      optimizing, but tend to cause the streetlight effect - you optimize for things that can be measured. Do you know what you&rsquo;re optimizing when you&rsquo;re still figuring out how a technology works and what it is good for? What would
      Licklider&rsquo;s metrics have been for a personal computing program? It is possible that energy has so few relevant metrics that a metrics-driven approach doesn&rsquo;t cut down on trying weird things, but I&rsquo;m skeptical. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">ARPA-E is not process-light. I have heard first hand accounts of inflexibility around hiring &ldquo;despite most of the work being in different parts of the country, you must be full time and in Washington or you will
      not be invited to all the meetings&rdquo; and tools &ldquo;you must use the government issued laptop for everything.&rdquo; This inflexibility goes against the conclusions that &nbsp;you should pay attention to DARPA&rsquo;s informal process
      and ignore formal process and that DARPA is incredibly flexible with who it hires to be program managers.</span></p>
  <h4  id="results"><span >Results</span></h4>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Most reports about ARPA-E&rsquo;s impact stress the number of projects they have funded and concrete outcomes are conspicuously absent. It feels like a dog-that-didn&rsquo;t-bark type situation. The closest to an
      outlier result was funding the research that led to a solar-cell company named 1366 hitting 19.6% efficiency.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">ARPA-E is also operating in a brutal area: the energy industry is notoriously conservative partially because it is behooven to many stakeholders: various kinds of investors, governments, customers, and non-customer
      residents in the areas where the energy company operates.</span></p>
  <h3  id="others"><span >Others</span></h3>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Many</span><span class=" 1">&nbsp;countries have a military R&amp;D organization that reporters occasionally refer to as &ldquo;The DARPA of X&rdquo; (for example Israel&rsquo;s </span><span ><a

        Agency (DSTA)</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">.) These organizations do work on advanced military technology but run their own labs and have the military as a more direct customer which makes them closer to Lockheed Skunkworks than DARPA.</span>
  </p>
  <h4  id="google_atap"><span >Google ATAP</span></h4>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Regina Dugan - a former DARPA Director - explicitly organized Google Advanced Technology And Projects (ATAP) to riff on DARPA&rsquo;s structure. ATAP does high-risk high-reward program-focused research that
      isn&rsquo;t afraid to explore new phenomena but leaves out empowered program managers and externalized research. These two missing components make it hard to consider it a true riff on DARPA. It&rsquo;s much more akin to a skunkworks.</span>
  </p>
  <h4  id="wellcome_leap"><span >Wellcome Leap</span></h4>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The Wellcome fund - a British foundation dedicated to funding health research - announced a new division called Leap in May 2020. From the scant information available online, Wellcome Leap seems to be organized around
      empowered program managers coordinating high-risk high-reward external research. From what I can tell, this is the closest a private entity has come to the platonic ARPA model, at least on paper. There are reasons for both optimism and
      skepticism about its potential outcomes. Its CEO, Regina Dugan, is a former DARPA director (who incidentally started Google ATAP.) Leap is nominally acknowledging that its programs will take time to come to fruition and have a high chance of
      failure. Hopefully, the things it has going for it will not be impeded by starting too big: it has a large ($300m) pool of money from day one.</span></p>
  <h4  id="british_arpa"><span >British ARPA</span></h4>
  <p ><span class=" 1">As of mid-2020 there has been a lot of talk about a British ARPA but not much apparent action. Dominic Cummings, Chief Advisor to the British Prime Minister, has written about a British ARPA many times and the
      Queen&rsquo;s speech at the end of 2019 featured the idea. Many people have weighed in online and the government is </span><span ><a
        href="https://committees.parliament.uk/submission/%23/evidence/119/preamble&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591636119739000">soliciting information about how it might work</a></span><span >. That may be a red flag
    </span><span >for an organization based on the idea of individual empowerment and non-consensus approaches.</span></p>

  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The dominant paradigm of starting an org is to do internalized R&amp;D unless you&rsquo;re a government or charitable foundation. In reality, R&amp;D orgs lie on a spectrum between externalized and internalized, with
      DARPA on one end and Lockheed Skunkworks on the other. Externalized research entails working through grants and contracts while internalized research is doing everything in house. There&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with building a
      Skunkworks - it just means that there are different tradeoffs and the statement &ldquo;DARPA for X&rdquo; is misleading.</span></p>
  <h3  id="most_darpa_clones_start_too_big_or_with_heavy_process"><span >Most DARPA clones start too big or with heavy process</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">DARPA started off small and informal. For years it was less than ten people.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Starting too big often </span><span class="emphasis">causes</span><span class=" 1">&nbsp;heavy</span><span class=" 1">&nbsp;process. People always spend money for a purpose, so the more money there is up front,

  <p ><span class=" 1">It raises the question of whether there is anything to be learned from the modern organization or whether we need to go completely off of historical accounts. &nbsp;Some of the post 1972 creations are still pretty
      significant - both autonomous cars and voice technology arguably haven&rsquo;t reached their potential yet. Additionally, we can attribute a chunk of the </span><span class="emphasis">perceived </span><span >outlier dropoff to

  <p ><span class=" 1">The </span><span class="link"><a  href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/1970/mansfield.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591636119746000">Mansfield
        Amendment</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;expressly limited ARPA funding to direct military applications and gave Congress more oversight into their spending. The amendment was part of broader attitude changes both inside the government and
      outside of it. Inside the government there was increasing discomfort with how ARPA Program Managers could spend money on basically anything they thought was worthwhile. Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t cut off just one tail of a distribution so
      these constraints definitely reduced the variance of DARPA results, both positive and negative. One might think that the technologies are so broadly applicable that &nbsp;smart program managers could work on anything under the umbrella of
      &ldquo;defense&rdquo; but from talking to former program managers, there are definitely DARPA-style ideas that DARPA doesn&rsquo;t pursue because they are not sufficiently defense related. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The economy also tanked in 1973, which contributed to Congress being &nbsp;more concerned about what they were getting for their money. &nbsp;They didn&rsquo;t want program managers like J.C.R. Licklider prancing
      around spending money that didn&rsquo;t have a clear payoff. This historical note emphasizes the point that to pull off long term projects, innovation orgs need to be aligned with their money factory so that they&rsquo;re not dependent on fair
      weather funding - sources of money that flow only when the economy is good or they&rsquo;re working on something popular. </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Outside the government, popular opinion turned against the military in the early 1970&rsquo;s, which both put pressure on elected officials and changed attitudes towards working with ARPA. The change in opinion
      made university researchers more hesitant to take military money. &nbsp;It also may have made fewer high quality people want to join the org, which arguably probably persists now. The stigma around working for the military puts additional
      weight on the question of </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#why_do_people_become_darpa_program_managers?">why do people become DARPA Program manager</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">s? &nbsp; </span></p>

  <ul >
    <li ><span >The Heilmeier Catechism</span><a id="footnote_source_13" class="internal-link" href="#footnote_13"><sup class="mark">[13]</sup></a><span >&nbsp;was introduced in 1975, so it did not contribute to any of the output in the
        60&rsquo;s or early 70&rsquo;s. In fact, </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#id.rki39dmnx711">Dominic Cummings</a></span><span >&nbsp;attributes the decline in output to its structure and an implied focus on results.
        There are arguments both ways. Many explicit DARPA rules like transient program managers are just codifications of previous implicit rules so the catechism may have been an informal rule of thumb test. Additionally, Heilmeier himself was an
        engineer who discovered phenomena that enabled liquid crystal displays so he presumably understood the process of true invention and discovery. On the </span><span class="emphasis">other</span><span >&nbsp;hand, he worked on planning
        for McNamara so he very much bought into a top-down mentality. </span><span >Verdict: </span><span class="note_to_reader">I&rsquo;m on the fence about whether to pay attention to this one - it seems like it could be useful as a thinking
        framework as long as it isn&rsquo;t used as a bludgeon.</span></li>
    <li ><span >Currently, DARPA managers do go/nogo checks every few months on performers. Program managers used to exert less explicit oversight over performers. </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#h.1bfc3kzfd4">I
          suspect that the ability to move money quickly away from things that aren&rsquo;t working is important though.</a></span><span >&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li ><span >In the 1960&rsquo;s DARPA program managers didn&rsquo;t do open solicitations for grants through an official government system - they just gave money to whom they wanted. </span><span >Verdict:
      </span><span class="note_to_reader">This is pure formal oversight. &nbsp;</span></li>
    <li ><span >In the 1960&rsquo;s it wasn&rsquo;t official policy that </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years">DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years</a></span><span
        >&nbsp; but the official policy was just a codification of the informal rules when Program Managers started hanging around too long. </span><span >Verdict: </span><span class="note_to_reader">While technically it&rsquo;s
        addition process, this is just a codification of an informal rule</span></li>
    <li ><span >Currently, </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#every_program_at_darpa_is_intensely_technically_scrutinized_by_the_tech_council">every program at DARPA is intensely technically scrutinized by the tech council </a></span><span >that then advises the
        director on whether to approve it. In the 1960&rsquo;s the process was a quick meeting between the Program Manager and the director laying out what they wanted to do. </span><span >Verdict: </span><span class="note_to_reader">This one is
        tricky - from conversations with program managers, the Tech Council sounds useful because it enables a clear goal for PMs without restricting what they do. </span></li>
    <li ><span >In 2001 DARPA changed who can be a prime contractor from anybody (including research labs and startups) to only large companies. </span><span >Verdict: </span><span >This one is

        argument that this is an adjustment for the fact that Corporate R&amp;D has declined and it&rsquo;s hard for startups to get products into production so one of DARPAs new roles is almost as a systems manager. This change may be worth paying
        attention to as a way that DARPA has adjusted to a changing world in a smart way.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul >
    <li ><span >Starting in 2001, DARPA directors began to sync up with presidential administrations. This suggests that there&rsquo;s been a shift in the politicization of the organization. </span><span

  </ul>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Together these raise the question ...</span></p>
  <h3  id="was_the_shift_from_arpa_to_darpa_and_changes_over_time_more_of_a_focus_change_or_a_process_change?"><span >Was the shift from ARPA to DARPA and changes over time more of a focus change or a process change?</span></h3>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The transition from ARPA to DARPA involved both a focus change to explicitly military projects and more formal process and oversight. Since most of DARPA&rsquo;s outlier output happened before 1972 the shift raises
      the question of whether the output dropoff &nbsp;was more a function of the change in DARPA&rsquo;s process or its focus. There are arguments for both ends of the spectrum. </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">The </span><span class="emphasis">process argument</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;is that after 1972 oversight and increased &nbsp;friction killed DARPA&rsquo;s ability to create outlier results. Both increased demand
      that programs have a waiting customer and increased spending scrutiny embodied by things like The Heilmeier Catechism and the Tech Council &nbsp;hamstrings program managers. This argument definitely has merit because small amounts of friction
      can have large effects and you can&rsquo;t cut off just one tail of a distribution.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">The </span><span class="emphasis">focus argument</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;is that we just don&rsquo;t see or appreciate as many of the things that come out of DARPA because they are specifically for military use and
      have less broad applicability.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">The focus vs. process question is important because it determines whether there is anything to be learned from how DARPA works today. If the changes in process that occurred after 1972 are the direct cause of the
      drop-off in outlier output, then analyzing the DARPA process today is worthless. If the focus shift caused the drop-off in outlier output, lessons from today&rsquo;s DARPA remain valuable. In reality, it is probably a mix of both.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">The visceral excitement that comes out of (recent) former program managers when I&rsquo;ve talked to them about their time at DARPA suggests that there are many things to be learned from the current organization
      that is not just cargo culting. At the same time, the majority of changes to DARPA over time have involved adding more explicit </span><span >process</span><span >. How can we resolve these two ideas? I would suggest
      that the solution is to </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#pay_attention_to_darpa&rsquo;s_informal_process_and_ignore_formal_process">pay attention to DARPA&rsquo;s informal process and ignore formal process.</a></span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">One non-focus, non-process reason for the change in outlier output &nbsp;may be that DARPA can&rsquo;t attract as many amazing people because they have better options or don&rsquo;t want to work on explicitly
      military things. If this were the case, it would severely affect output </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#at_the_end_of_the_day_the_arpa_model_depends_on_badass_program_managers_which_mirrors_the_obsession_with_&ldquo;talent&rdquo;_in_other_disciplines">because the ARPA model is so heavily dependent on great PMs</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">. However, there are
      still super high quality people in DARPA so this cannot explain all the changes.</span></p>
  <h3  id="pay_attention_to_darpa&rsquo;s_informal_process_and_ignore_formal_process"><span >Pay attention to DARPA&rsquo;s informal process and ignore formal process</span></h3>
  <p ><span class=" 1">For the most part there&rsquo;s been few changes in the weird things about how DARPA&rsquo;s program managers work compared to other organizations, the incentives and structure of the organization, the funding,
      and general shape of the process. So it is not worthless to study the modern organization. Regardless of whether or not the </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#a_list_of_changes_over_time">changes in formal process </a></span><span
      >are the reason that </span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#most_of_darpa&rsquo;s_outlier_output_happened_before_1972">most of DARPA&rsquo;s outlier output happened before 1972</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">, they certainly didn&rsquo;t help. Therefore, if you want to
      replicate DARPA&rsquo;s outlier success, it makes sense to pay attention to DARPA&rsquo;s informal process and ignore formal process.</span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">Usually, formal </span><span class=" 1">process is</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;put into place to increase oversight and decrease reliance on trust. Formal process lets people outside the organization trust in
      the process instead of the people. Ignoring the formal process makes the success of an organization depend more on trust in people. </span></p>
  <p ><span class=" 1">This trust-dependence means that it is essential for an organization that seeks to replicate DARPA&rsquo;s success to start with </span><span class="emphasis">trust</span><span class=" 1">&nbsp;from funders and
      collaborators outside the organization. The trust-dependence creates a chicken-and-egg situation because by definition new models and organizations do not have a track record and the people who are most likely to create a new game are ones who
      haven&rsquo;t won at other games.</span></p>

  <p ><span >As I noted</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span class="link"><a  class="internal-link" href="#h.29p4exze5lg2">at the beginning</a></span><span class="note_to_reader">, the entire point of this document is to inform action. This is not the
      place for a deep dive on what those actions could and should be but I wanted to leave you with some sketchy questions and considerations for replicating DARPA&rsquo;s outlier success that I plan to tackle.</span></p>
  <p ><span >The first question, of course: &ldquo;is it worthwhile to riff on the ARPA model?&rdquo; Yes. </span><a id="kix.yz3zlaeh2rd5"></a><span class="note_to_reader">It&rsquo;s notable that in conversations with former PMs, they
      explicitly noted that there are many program ideas that are shelved (and often forgotten) because they fall outside of DARPA&rsquo;s military-focused scope. If anything we need it now more than ever. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader">Does an ARPA need to be a government organization? Is it possible to create a private ARPA? Nothing suggests that it&rsquo;s impossible, but there are several pieces that need to be figured out first. </span></p>
  <p ><span class="3 1">Some uncomfortable truths:</span></p>
  <ul >
    <li class=" 9"><span class="note_to_reader">Anybody attempting to riff on the ARPA model needs to be willing to sit with a lot of discomfort for a long time - the best ARPA programs often take a decade or more to come to fruition.</span></li>
    <li class=" 9"><span class="note_to_reader">You can&rsquo;t be in it for short term glory. Opacity is important to DARPA&rsquo;s outlier success so the industry standard flashy announcements about what you&rsquo;re going to do are off the table. </span>
    </li>
    <li class=" 9"><span >You will need to work on things </span><span >before</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;they&rsquo;re sexy. The whole point of the organization is to make unsexy things sexy, not hop on the latest hype
        train.</span></li>
    <li class=" 9"><span class="note_to_reader">Attempting to replicate DARPA-style successes may involve doing several things that go against Silicon Valley dogma:</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul >
    <li class=" 2"><span class="note_to_reader">Value capture might be really hard or impossible. Externalized research does seem structural to the model and value capture primarily happens on work done inside an organization. The role of DARPA as an
        in-between thing feels weirdly important - again this is awkward for value capture. This also suggests that riffs on ARPA probably will not look a normal fund or startup.</span></li>
    <li class=" 2"><span class="note_to_reader">Planning is important and might suggest resurrecting the dark art of systems management.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul >
    <li class=" 9"><span class="note_to_reader">There is the awkward tradeoff between the need to start small and the fact that there may be a minimum size to pull it off successfully. You could imagine a situation where you start small and just do program
        design for a few programs and once that is done, you use those designed programs to bring in the money to execute on them. However, that would put the organization in a position to be judged on unsexy and weird programs. It would hamstring
        the ability to quickly begin executing. One of the reasons companies and researchers are willing to engage with PMs seriously so early in the process is that they know the PMs are &lsquo;good for it.&rsquo; &nbsp;Maybe there&rsquo;s a
        tranched solution.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader"></span></p>
  <p ><span >A big consideration for anybody hoping to emulate DARPA&rsquo;s success outside of a government agency is the question of &lsquo;how will money work?&rsquo; The ideal situation would be for the organization to be
    </span><span >its own</span><span class="note_to_reader">&nbsp;money factory, but it might be impossible to accomplish that while preserving the structurally important pieces of the ARPA model. Another huge consideration is how to set up
      incentives both to work with high quality PMs and for potential performers in big companies, small companies, and academia to take you seriously. These considerations suggest that replicating ARPA&rsquo;s success outside of a government might
      require truly new organizational structures.</span></p>
  <p ><span class="note_to_reader"></span></p>
  <p ><span >There are also exciting places where it may be possible to riff on the model. Building more structured roadmapping frameworks could make program design even more effective. You might be able to build trust during the
      program design period by having potential PMs do a &lsquo;residency&rsquo; instead of making an upfront binary decision. It&rsquo;s even possible that program design and execution could be decoupled. You could seed even more awesome if another
      organization is willing to execute on the program after it&rsquo;s been </span><span >derisked</span><span >&nbsp;by showing that it is both not impossible and is in fact possible. These are just a few of the possibilities!
